I am a business development manager in Preanalytical Systems.  I am responsible for seeking and bringing into BD new technology, product and service opportunities that will increase revenue growth for the unit. I enjoy business development because I am able to use my background in science and business to identify new technologies that could provide innovative solutions for people to live healthy lives.  An important component of my job is to be aware of the latest and greatest innovations while simultaneously discerning whether or not there is a strategic business opportunity for the innovation.  This is an exciting and challenging task which I enjoy immensely. Outside of work, I enjoy playing sports, mentoring youth, and spending time with my husband and daughter. return to top Business Development (Corporate) Name: Brian University/Degree: UC-San Diego, B.S. in Biochemistry; Kellogg School of Management, MBA Position: Corporate Strategy and Development Manager view video Before entering business school, I spent five years working in Operations at a large biopharmaceutical company. While I enjoyed the healthcare industry, I decided to go back to school to learn more about the other parts of the business.  It was between my first and second years at Kellogg that I took a marketing internship with BD Diagnostics in Baltimore. From the very start, BD stood out among other companies because they cared about my personal development in addition to what they thought I could contribute to the company. They worked with me to identify an internship project that matched the type of experience I was seeking. Over the course of the 10-week internship I had the chance to work with many talented people across the Diagnostics organization in Baltimore and corporate headquarters in Franklin Lakes, NJ. During this time, I was impressed by BD’s collaborative culture and their “always seeking to improve” attitude. Equally impressive was the amount of exposure and interaction I had with senior level leadership. After having had a positive internship experience at BD, I decided to join full time. Although many factors influenced my decision, such as BD’s global leadership position in the medical technology industry and its diverse product portfolio, the most important was the chance to work with people with significant industry experience who have a passion for helping all people live healthy lives. I believe that these factors will enable me to enjoy many different opportunities within BD over the course of my career, while also contributing to advancements in patient care globally. I currently work as a Manager in the Corporate Strategy and Development group. The role was extremely attractive to me because it provides me with the opportunity to work with many different groups across the organization and to apply the skills I developed in business school. On a weekly basis, I wear “different hats” as I work on a number of assignments that deal with M&A, investments, licensing deals, and internal strategy consulting. In my first few months in this role, I was able to interact with people from all three business segments, and I was able to contribute to a number of business-critical projects. I could not be more pleased with my decision to join BD. I feel like I have found the perfect fit and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.  return to top Technology Leadership Development Program Name: Molly University/Degree:  Brown University, ScB in Bio-Mechanical Engineering; Duke University, Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering Materials Science Program: Principal Engineer in BD Medical - Medical Surgical Systems, member of the Technology Leadership Development Program view video I learned about BD through an information session on campus at Duke. I had used BD products in the lab but had not known about the opportunities available for careers at BD.  I joined BD because both the company values and the position were in line with what I wanted in a career. I wanted to work for a company that had an interest in making society better, both locally and globally. As a medical technology company, the impact of the work you do at BD is large. We don’t produce a thousand devices; we produce tens of millions of them, so the opportunity to make an impact is great.  My role at BD is as a Principal Engineer in Advanced Concept Development. This means that I work at the front-end of product development, generating new ideas, determining products the customer will want next or finding unmet clinical needs that can be addressed. I am involved in all parts of the concept stage, from R&D to marketing to intellectual property. The thing I like most about my role at BD is that it is different day-to-day. One day I might be reading patents and the next I might be looking at BD’s sales from previous years to determine a market size.  When I’m not working, I like to cook and try to find time to read, but most of my time is spent working on my house, doing fun things like painting, hanging pictures or planting trees. Return to top Name: Hector Title: Basic Support Team Leader University/Degree: UPIICSA, Mexico, B.S. in Information Science; ITESM, Mexico, Diplomat degree, digital telecommunications; Steven's Institute of Technology, Hoboken, N.J., M.S. in Information Systems Riding to school many years ago, I used to pass by the BD plant in Cuautitlán, Mexico. At that time I did not know anything about the company, but when my younger brother was diagnosed with Insulin-dependent diabetes, I learned first-hand the value of BD products. BD Plastipak™ syringes back then made a huge difference in my brother's quality of life. When I later learned of the opportunities at BD in my field of study, I felt working at this company would be a great chance for me to do the work I know and enjoy. I joined BD as a Senior SAP Basis Administrator. What I like most about my job is that working with SAP applications is an everyday learning experience. There is always room for improvement. Our team worked on a recent recovery and re-installation of the Advanced Planning and Optimizer system after a hardware failure - a tough task but the teamwork was exemplary. When I'm not working, I keep busy with my children. I enjoy many activities, such as music, basketball and photography. I'm also a wine enthusiast. return to top Name: Conrad Title: Program Manager University/Degree: Washington and Lee University, B.A. in Economics, Rider University, MBA I had known about BD for years, although I was not aware of the breadth of BD's product offerings. I was contacted by a recruiter for the position I currently hold. I was very interested in the particular job opportunity I was offered, but I really decided to join BD because I was impressed with the diversity of people and culture I came in contact with during my interview process. I was hired as a Program Manager for Anesthesia Systems two years ago and I am still in that position, although my day-to-day responsibilities have changed. I believe that with persistence and dedication I can truly make an impact through my work. I am also impressed with the way BD lives its Core Values on a daily basis. When BD purchased a business from another company, I was hired to manage the integration of that business into BD. My team was able to accomplish this mission on time and within budget. I am very proud of the way this team came together to make this happen. When I'm not working, I like to spend time with my family and friends, play guitar, try to keep in shape, enjoy new foods, and generally have a good time. return to top Name: Mohan Title: Senior Market Segment Leader University/Degree: Birla Institute of Technology and Science in India, M.Sc. (Hons.) (Chemistry) I learned about BD from the director of a well-known medical school in Dehli, India, whose first stethoscope as a medical student, which was made by BD, was hanging proudly as a trophy in his living room. BD began operations in India in 1989, and I felt my career growth would be enhanced with an internationally known company. I was the third associate hired at BD in India and was responsible for Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC) as Business Manager of Primary Care Diagnostics. In my present position as Senior Market Segment Team Leader, I enjoy the freedom the position allows to operate and deliver the results expected of me. I am most proud of our team's development and introduction of a new needle product for Asia. BD's Core Values, a good Human Resource Planning process, the recognition of contributions, rewards aligned to contributions, and learning opportunities are just a few reasons why I continue my career at BD. Outside of work, I watch cricket and tennis (I used to play both), and read historical novels (mainly about Indian history). return to top Name: Glen Title: Sterilization Specialist University/Degree: Florida State University, B.S. in Physics/Mathematics I became familiar with BD because I previously worked with a company that did business with it. I accepted the position of Sterilization Specialist because I wanted to work for a reputable company. What I like most about my job, and BD as an employer, is working with great people every day. One accomplishment I am most proud of is serving as a business unit representative and team member for a successful start-up of a new sterilization facility. Challenging work, great people and great opportunities keep me working at BD. In my spare time, I enjoy playing and watching sports, walking, bike riding, reading and traveling. return to top Name: Rita Title: Associate Medical Director of BD Medical Medical Surgical Systems University/Degree: Received medical degree in Brazil; completed residencies (general practitioner and endocrinology); special studies in pharmaceutical medicine and business administration; Masters degree in neuroendocrinology. As a physician, I knew of BD products. They have always been synonymous with quality and innovation. Before joining BD, I was working for a pharmaceutical company in So Paolo, Brazil. When a headhunter approached me about working for BD, I jumped at the chance. I loved the idea of working for BD for several reasons: first, the position offered a wonderful challenge, namely to be the first medical director in the South Latin America (SLA) Region. I would also have the opportunity to initiate projects and understand the practices of other countries. I became the Regional Medical Director of SLA in 2004 and came to Franklin Lakes in 2007 as Associate Medical Director in BD Medical - Medical Surgical Systems, where I am today. I love to help people, which, as a physician, is so important to my life. Because BD is a global company, every time we solve a problem or work on an innovative idea, we are effectively helping people all over the world to live healthy lives. I feel great about that! I am very proud of my work as a member of the Platform Team Medical Affairs group as well as a Core Team Medical Affairs member in Global Product Development Systems projects. I feel that through my work on these teams I am really helping patients as well as healthcare workers. There is much opportunity to continue learning and for growth. In my free time, I like to keep up with cultural events and I love to sing. return to top Information Technology Leadership Program (ITLP) Name: Olawole University/Degree: Rutgers University/NJIT, B.A. in Information Systems Program: Information Technology Leadership Program - SAP BW Presentation Developer I learned about BD through an INROADS training and development seminar on BD’s campus. We were given presentations on BD and its global efforts to help all people live healthy lives.  I was very impressed by the presentations and the campus setting and environment. An opportunity within the Information Technology Leadership Program listed on Rutgers career development website that caught my attention. I wanted to join after researching the position and BD's outstanding history and tradition.  I am a member of the ITLP. In my first rotation, I am a SAP Business Warehouse Presentation Developer. I create, maintain and support our Business Intelligence reporting tools and systems. My job allows me to learn about the technical and business aspects of the Business Intelligence and Data Management group. It also gives me the opportunity to work with business analysts, partners and stakeholders. My job allows me to work on value-added activities and solutions. When I am not working, I like reading and assistant coaching youth basketball teams. return to top Manufacturing Development Program (MDP) Name: Stefanie University/Degree: University of Connecticut, B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Minor in Biomedical Engineering Program: Manufacturing Development Program Through my job search of medical device and medical technology companies, I came across the BD company website.  I knew I wanted to be a part of a company that helped people, so I was immediately drawn to BD’s purpose of “Helping all people live healthy lives.”  I also learned about the positive involvement that the company has in the community, and the opportunities that are given to employees to make a difference, both locally and around the world.  The more that I discovered about BD, the more I knew it was the right place for me. I am now a part of the Manufacturing Development Program, a three-year rotational program that exposes entry-level engineers to a variety of work assignments in manufacturing, quality, and research and development.  Each year, participants rotate into new positions at different BD locations, gaining diverse experiences and developing professionally.  I am currently in my first rotation of the program, working as a Manufacturing Support Engineer in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.  In this role, I am helping to support the operations of BD’s Diabetes Care facilities worldwide.  I have been exposed to the mold validation process, helped in resolving quality issues, and worked closely on cross-functional teams.  In my future rotations, I will likely get hands-on experiences in high-and-low volume manufacturing, learn to implement different continuous improvement strategies, and manage several different projects.  Being just out of college, I am excited about being able to experience so many different aspects of engineering in just a few years.  In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking, and being an active alumnae and Regional Field Director of my sorority. return to top Strategic Sourcing Development Program (SSDP) Name: Lei University/Degree:  Penn State University, B.S. in Supply Chain & Information Systems Program: Strategic Sourcing Development Program           I first learned about BD when I was browsing for job opportunities on the Penn State Career website. The reputation of BD and the description of the program persuaded me into competing for an interview spot with the company. I’ve always wanted to work for a medical company, and I have a strong interest in exploring career opportunities in Procurement. The Strategic Sourcing Development Program allows me to take on different roles and become proficient in procurement and the strategic sourcing processes. I like my group and my position because strategic sourcing is a fast-paced area, loaded with talented people, challenges and responsibilities. When I am not working, I like to join other BD associates in the after-hours activities that enable me to get familiar with people outside of my group.       return to top Supply Chain Development Program (SCDP) Name: Dipti University/Degree:  Penn State University, B.S. in Industrial Engineering Program: Supply Chain Development Program I came to know about BD from a supply chain career fair when I was looking for an internship. I interned here during the summer of 2006 and was offered a full-time position in SCDP. I decided to work for BD after graduation for a few reasons: BD culture was very welcoming, with a lot of friendly people to guide you along, and as a healthcare company which would give me good job satisfaction, competitive benefits, good location, and more. I started my third rotation in Transportation in January 2008. Some of the areas I will be exposed to within this rotation are the operational side of transportation, the freight payment process, service complaints and carrier management. My first rotation was in supply chain planning in the BD Medical - Pharmaceutical Systems unit. There, I was involved with demand forecasting, rough cut capacity planning and third-party sterilization planning. I worked on various analyses such as sterilization cycle time and building a weekly production schedule. My second rotation was with the Customer Service Call Center for BD Medical. There I was responsible for assisting customers with their inquiries on the phone, taking customer orders, analyzing service complaints, and more. The rotational program has been exposing me to many different areas within BD, which is helping me decide which areas I would like to seek long-term career opportunities. return to top

view video,  Before entering business school, I spent five years working in Operations at a large biopharmaceutical company. While I enjoyed the healthcare industry, I decided to go back to school to learn more about the other parts of the business.  It was between my first and second years at Kellogg that I took a marketing internship with BD Diagnostics in Baltimore. From the very start, BD stood out among other companies because they cared about my personal development in addition to what they thought I could contribute to the company. They worked with me to identify an internship project that matched the type of experience I was seeking. Over the course of the 10-week internship I had the chance to work with many talented people across the Diagnostics organization in Baltimore and corporate headquarters in Franklin Lakes, NJ. During this time, I was impressed by BD’s collaborative culture and their “always seeking to improve” attitude. Equally impressive was the amount of exposure and interaction I had with senior level leadership. After having had a positive internship experience at BD, I decided to join full time. Although many factors influenced my decision, such as BD’s global leadership position in the medical technology industry and its diverse product portfolio, the most important was the chance to work with people with significant industry experience who have a passion for helping all people live healthy lives. I believe that these factors will enable me to enjoy many different opportunities within BD over the course of my career, while also contributing to advancements in patient care globally. I currently work as a Manager in the Corporate Strategy and Development group. The role was extremely attractive to me because it provides me with the opportunity to work with many different groups across the organization and to apply the skills I developed in business school. On a weekly basis, I wear “different hats” as I work on a number of assignments that deal with M&A, investments, licensing deals, and internal strategy consulting. In my first few months in this role, I was able to interact with people from all three business segments, and I was able to contribute to a number of business-critical projects. I could not be more pleased with my decision to join BD. I feel like I have found the perfect fit and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.

While I enjoyed the healthcare industry, I decided to go back to school to learn more about the other parts of the business.  It was between my first and second years at Kellogg that I took a marketing internship with BD Diagnostics in Baltimore. From the very start, BD stood out among other companies because they cared about my personal development in addition to what they thought I could contribute to the company. They worked with me to identify an internship project that matched the type of experience I was seeking. Over the course of the 10-week internship I had the chance to work with many talented people across the Diagnostics organization in Baltimore and corporate headquarters in Franklin Lakes, NJ.

I had used BD products in the lab but had not known about the opportunities available for careers at BD.  I joined BD because both the company values and the position were in line with what I wanted in a career. I wanted to work for a company that had an interest in making society better, both locally and globally. As a medical technology company, the impact of the work you do at BD is large. We don’t produce a thousand devices; we produce tens of millions of them, so the opportunity to make an impact is great.  My role at BD is as a Principal Engineer in Advanced Concept Development. This means that I work at the front-end of product development, generating new ideas, determining products the customer will want next or finding unmet clinical needs that can be addressed. I am involved in all parts of the concept stage, from R&D to marketing to intellectual property. The thing I like most about my role at BD is that it is different day-to-day. One day I might be reading patents and the next I might be looking at BD’s sales from previous years to determine a market size.  When I’m not working, I like to cook and try to find time to read, but most of my time is spent working on my house, doing fun things like painting, hanging pictures or planting trees.

At that time I did not know anything about the company, but when my younger brother was diagnosed with Insulin-dependent diabetes, I learned first-hand the value of BD products. BD Plastipak™ syringes back then made a huge difference in my brother's quality of life. When I later learned of the opportunities at BD in my field of study, I felt working at this company would be a great chance for me to do the work I know and enjoy. I joined BD as a Senior SAP Basis Administrator. What I like most about my job is that working with SAP applications is an everyday learning experience. There is always room for improvement. Our team worked on a recent recovery and re-installation of the Advanced Planning and Optimizer system after a hardware failure - a tough task but the teamwork was exemplary. When I'm not working, I keep busy with my children. I enjoy many activities, such as music, basketball and photography.

I was contacted by a recruiter for the position I currently hold. I was very interested in the particular job opportunity I was offered, but I really decided to join BD because I was impressed with the diversity of people and culture I came in contact with during my interview process. I was hired as a Program Manager for Anesthesia Systems two years ago and I am still in that position, although my day-to-day responsibilities have changed. I believe that with persistence and dedication I can truly make an impact through my work. I am also impressed with the way BD lives its Core Values on a daily basis. When BD purchased a business from another company, I was hired to manage the integration of that business into BD. My team was able to accomplish this mission on time and within budget. I am very proud of the way this team came together to make this happen. When I'm not working, I like to spend time with my family and friends, play guitar, try to keep in shape, enjoy new foods, and generally have a good time. return to top,  Name: Mohan Title: Senior Market Segment Leader University/Degree: Birla Institute of Technology and Science in India, M.Sc. (Hons.) (Chemistry) I learned about BD from the director of a well-known medical school in Dehli, India, whose first stethoscope as a medical student, which was made by BD, was hanging proudly as a trophy in his living room. BD began operations in India in 1989, and I felt my career growth would be enhanced with an internationally known company. I was the third associate hired at BD in India and was responsible for Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC) as Business Manager of Primary Care Diagnostics. In my present position as Senior Market Segment Team Leader, I enjoy the freedom the position allows to operate and deliver the results expected of me. I am most proud of our team's development and introduction of a new needle product for Asia. BD's Core Values, a good Human Resource Planning process, the recognition of contributions, rewards aligned to contributions, and learning opportunities are just a few reasons why I continue my career at BD.

I accepted the position of Sterilization Specialist because I wanted to work for a reputable company. What I like most about my job, and BD as an employer, is working with great people every day. One accomplishment I am most proud of is serving as a business unit representative and team member for a successful start-up of a new sterilization facility.

As a physician, I knew of BD products. They have always been synonymous with quality and innovation. Before joining BD, I was working for a pharmaceutical company in So Paolo, Brazil. When a headhunter approached me about working for BD, I jumped at the chance. I loved the idea of working for BD for several reasons: first, the position offered a wonderful challenge, namely to be the first medical director in the South Latin America (SLA) Region. I would also have the opportunity to initiate projects and understand the practices of other countries. I became the Regional Medical Director of SLA in 2004 and came to Franklin Lakes in 2007 as Associate Medical Director in BD Medical - Medical Surgical Systems, where I am today. I love to help people, which, as a physician, is so important to my life. Because BD is a global company, every time we solve a problem or work on an innovative idea, we are effectively helping people all over the world to live healthy lives. I feel great about that! I am very proud of my work as a member of the Platform Team Medical Affairs group as well as a Core Team Medical Affairs member in Global Product Development Systems projects.

An opportunity within the Information Technology Leadership Program listed on Rutgers career development website that caught my attention. I wanted to join after researching the position and BD's outstanding history and tradition.  I am a member of the ITLP. In my first rotation, I am a SAP Business Warehouse Presentation Developer. I create, maintain and support our Business Intelligence reporting tools and systems. My job allows me to learn about the technical and business aspects of the Business Intelligence and Data Management group.

I am now a part of the Manufacturing Development Program, a three-year rotational program that exposes entry-level engineers to a variety of work assignments in manufacturing, quality, and research and development.  Each year, participants rotate into new positions at different BD locations, gaining diverse experiences and developing professionally.  I am currently in my first rotation of the program, working as a Manufacturing Support Engineer in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.  In this role, I am helping to support the operations of BD’s Diabetes Care facilities worldwide.  I have been exposed to the mold validation process, helped in resolving quality issues, and worked closely on cross-functional teams.  In my future rotations, I will likely get hands-on experiences in high-and-low volume manufacturing, learn to implement different continuous improvement strategies, and manage several different projects.  Being just out of college, I am excited about being able to experience so many different aspects of engineering in just a few years.  In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking, and being an active alumnae and Regional Field Director of my sorority. return to top,  Strategic Sourcing Development Program (SSDP) Name: Lei University/Degree:  Penn State University, B.S. in Supply Chain & Information Systems Program: Strategic Sourcing Development Program           I first learned about BD when I was browsing for job opportunities on the Penn State Career website.

I’ve always wanted to work for a medical company, and I have a strong interest in exploring career opportunities in Procurement. The Strategic Sourcing Development Program allows me to take on different roles and become proficient in procurement and the strategic sourcing processes. I like my group and my position because strategic sourcing is a fast-paced area, loaded with talented people, challenges and responsibilities.

I interned here during the summer of 2006 and was offered a full-time position in SCDP. I decided to work for BD after graduation for a few reasons: BD culture was very welcoming, with a lot of friendly people to guide you along, and as a healthcare company which would give me good job satisfaction, competitive benefits, good location, and more. I started my third rotation in Transportation in January 2008. Some of the areas I will be exposed to within this rotation are the operational side of transportation, the freight payment process, service complaints and carrier management. My first rotation was in supply chain planning in the BD Medical - Pharmaceutical Systems unit. There, I was involved with demand forecasting, rough cut capacity planning and third-party sterilization planning. I worked on various analyses such as sterilization cycle time and building a weekly production schedule. My second rotation was with the Customer Service Call Center for BD Medical. There I was responsible for assisting customers with their inquiries on the phone, taking customer orders, analyzing service complaints, and more. The rotational program has been exposing me to many different areas within BD, which is helping me decide which areas I would like to seek long-term career opportunities. return to top,

I am a business development manager in Preanalytical Systems.  I am responsible for seeking and bringing into BD new technology, product and service opportunities that will increase revenue growth for the unit. I enjoy business development because I am able to use my background in science and business to identify new technologies that could provide innovative solutions for people to live healthy lives.  An important component of my job is to be aware of the latest and greatest innovations while simultaneously discerning whether or not there is a strategic business opportunity for the innovation.  This is an exciting and challenging task which I enjoy immensely. Outside of work, I enjoy playing sports, mentoring youth, and spending time with my husband and daughter. return to top,  Business Development (Corporate) Name: Brian University/Degree: UC-San Diego, B.S. in Biochemistry; Kellogg School of Management, MBA Position: Corporate Strategy and Development Manager view video Before entering business school, I spent five years working in Operations at a large biopharmaceutical company. While I enjoyed the healthcare industry, I decided to go back to school to learn more about the other parts of the business.  It was between my first and second years at Kellogg that I took a marketing internship with BD Diagnostics in Baltimore. From the very start, BD stood out among other companies because they cared about my personal development in addition to what they thought I could contribute to the company. They worked with me to identify an internship project that matched the type of experience I was seeking. Over the course of the 10-week internship I had the chance to work with many talented people across the Diagnostics organization in Baltimore and corporate headquarters in Franklin Lakes, NJ. During this time, I was impressed by BD’s collaborative culture and their “always seeking to improve” attitude. Equally impressive was the amount of exposure and interaction I had with senior level leadership. After having had a positive internship experience at BD, I decided to join full time. Although many factors influenced my decision, such as BD’s global leadership position in the medical technology industry and its diverse product portfolio, the most important was the chance to work with people with significant industry experience who have a passion for helping all people live healthy lives. I believe that these factors will enable me to enjoy many different opportunities within BD over the course of my career, while also contributing to advancements in patient care globally. I currently work as a Manager in the Corporate Strategy and Development group. The role was extremely attractive to me because it provides me with the opportunity to work with many different groups across the organization and to apply the skills I developed in business school. On a weekly basis, I wear “different hats” as I work on a number of assignments that deal with M&A, investments, licensing deals, and internal strategy consulting. In my first few months in this role, I was able to interact with people from all three business segments, and I was able to contribute to a number of business-critical projects. I could not be more pleased with my decision to join BD. I feel like I have found the perfect fit and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.  return to top,  Technology Leadership Development Program Name: Molly University/Degree:  Brown University, ScB in Bio-Mechanical Engineering; Duke University, Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering Materials Science Program: Principal Engineer in BD Medical - Medical Surgical Systems, member of the Technology Leadership Development Program view video I learned about BD through an information session on campus at Duke. I had used BD products in the lab but had not known about the opportunities available for careers at BD.  I joined BD because both the company values and the position were in line with what I wanted in a career. I wanted to work for a company that had an interest in making society better, both locally and globally. As a medical technology company, the impact of the work you do at BD is large. We don’t produce a thousand devices; we produce tens of millions of them, so the opportunity to make an impact is great.  My role at BD is as a Principal Engineer in Advanced Concept Development. This means that I work at the front-end of product development, generating new ideas, determining products the customer will want next or finding unmet clinical needs that can be addressed. I am involved in all parts of the concept stage, from R&D to marketing to intellectual property. The thing I like most about my role at BD is that it is different day-to-day. One day I might be reading patents and the next I might be looking at BD’s sales from previous years to determine a market size.  When I’m not working, I like to cook and try to find time to read, but most of my time is spent working on my house, doing fun things like painting, hanging pictures or planting trees. Return to top Name: Hector Title: Basic Support Team Leader University/Degree: UPIICSA, Mexico, B.S. in Information Science; ITESM, Mexico, Diplomat degree, digital telecommunications; Steven's Institute of Technology, Hoboken, N.J., M.S. in Information Systems Riding to school many years ago, I used to pass by the BD plant in Cuautitlán, Mexico. At that time I did not know anything about the company, but when my younger brother was diagnosed with Insulin-dependent diabetes, I learned first-hand the value of BD products. BD Plastipak™ syringes back then made a huge difference in my brother's quality of life. When I later learned of the opportunities at BD in my field of study, I felt working at this company would be a great chance for me to do the work I know and enjoy. I joined BD as a Senior SAP Basis Administrator. What I like most about my job is that working with SAP applications is an everyday learning experience. There is always room for improvement. Our team worked on a recent recovery and re-installation of the Advanced Planning and Optimizer system after a hardware failure - a tough task but the teamwork was exemplary. When I'm not working, I keep busy with my children. I enjoy many activities, such as music, basketball and photography. I'm also a wine enthusiast. return to top,  Name: Conrad Title: Program Manager University/Degree: Washington and Lee University, B.A. in Economics, Rider University, MBA I had known about BD for years, although I was not aware of the breadth of BD's product offerings. I was contacted by a recruiter for the position I currently hold. I was very interested in the particular job opportunity I was offered, but I really decided to join BD because I was impressed with the diversity of people and culture I came in contact with during my interview process. I was hired as a Program Manager for Anesthesia Systems two years ago and I am still in that position, although my day-to-day responsibilities have changed. I believe that with persistence and dedication I can truly make an impact through my work. I am also impressed with the way BD lives its Core Values on a daily basis. When BD purchased a business from another company, I was hired to manage the integration of that business into BD. My team was able to accomplish this mission on time and within budget. I am very proud of the way this team came together to make this happen. When I'm not working, I like to spend time with my family and friends, play guitar, try to keep in shape, enjoy new foods, and generally have a good time. return to top,  Name: Mohan Title: Senior Market Segment Leader University/Degree: Birla Institute of Technology and Science in India, M.Sc. (Hons.) (Chemistry) I learned about BD from the director of a well-known medical school in Dehli, India, whose first stethoscope as a medical student, which was made by BD, was hanging proudly as a trophy in his living room. BD began operations in India in 1989, and I felt my career growth would be enhanced with an internationally known company. I was the third associate hired at BD in India and was responsible for Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC) as Business Manager of Primary Care Diagnostics. In my present position as Senior Market Segment Team Leader, I enjoy the freedom the position allows to operate and deliver the results expected of me. I am most proud of our team's development and introduction of a new needle product for Asia. BD's Core Values, a good Human Resource Planning process, the recognition of contributions, rewards aligned to contributions, and learning opportunities are just a few reasons why I continue my career at BD. Outside of work, I watch cricket and tennis (I used to play both), and read historical novels (mainly about Indian history). return to top,  Name: Glen Title: Sterilization Specialist University/Degree: Florida State University, B.S. in Physics/Mathematics I became familiar with BD because I previously worked with a company that did business with it. I accepted the position of Sterilization Specialist because I wanted to work for a reputable company. What I like most about my job, and BD as an employer, is working with great people every day. One accomplishment I am most proud of is serving as a business unit representative and team member for a successful start-up of a new sterilization facility. Challenging work, great people and great opportunities keep me working at BD. In my spare time, I enjoy playing and watching sports, walking, bike riding, reading and traveling. return to top,  Name: Rita Title: Associate Medical Director of BD Medical Medical Surgical Systems University/Degree: Received medical degree in Brazil; completed residencies (general practitioner and endocrinology); special studies in pharmaceutical medicine and business administration; Masters degree in neuroendocrinology. As a physician, I knew of BD products. They have always been synonymous with quality and innovation. Before joining BD, I was working for a pharmaceutical company in So Paolo, Brazil. When a headhunter approached me about working for BD, I jumped at the chance. I loved the idea of working for BD for several reasons: first, the position offered a wonderful challenge, namely to be the first medical director in the South Latin America (SLA) Region. I would also have the opportunity to initiate projects and understand the practices of other countries. I became the Regional Medical Director of SLA in 2004 and came to Franklin Lakes in 2007 as Associate Medical Director in BD Medical - Medical Surgical Systems, where I am today. I love to help people, which, as a physician, is so important to my life. Because BD is a global company, every time we solve a problem or work on an innovative idea, we are effectively helping people all over the world to live healthy lives. I feel great about that! I am very proud of my work as a member of the Platform Team Medical Affairs group as well as a Core Team Medical Affairs member in Global Product Development Systems projects. I feel that through my work on these teams I am really helping patients as well as healthcare workers. There is much opportunity to continue learning and for growth. In my free time, I like to keep up with cultural events and I love to sing. return to top,  Information Technology Leadership Program (ITLP) Name: Olawole University/Degree: Rutgers University/NJIT, B.A. in Information Systems Program: Information Technology Leadership Program - SAP BW Presentation Developer I learned about BD through an INROADS training and development seminar on BD’s campus. We were given presentations on BD and its global efforts to help all people live healthy lives.  I was very impressed by the presentations and the campus setting and environment. An opportunity within the Information Technology Leadership Program listed on Rutgers career development website that caught my attention. I wanted to join after researching the position and BD's outstanding history and tradition.  I am a member of the ITLP. In my first rotation, I am a SAP Business Warehouse Presentation Developer. I create, maintain and support our Business Intelligence reporting tools and systems. My job allows me to learn about the technical and business aspects of the Business Intelligence and Data Management group. It also gives me the opportunity to work with business analysts, partners and stakeholders. My job allows me to work on value-added activities and solutions. When I am not working, I like reading and assistant coaching youth basketball teams. return to top,  Manufacturing Development Program (MDP) Name: Stefanie University/Degree: University of Connecticut, B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Minor in Biomedical Engineering Program: Manufacturing Development Program Through my job search of medical device and medical technology companies, I came across the BD company website.  I knew I wanted to be a part of a company that helped people, so I was immediately drawn to BD’s purpose of “Helping all people live healthy lives.”  I also learned about the positive involvement that the company has in the community, and the opportunities that are given to employees to make a difference, both locally and around the world.  The more that I discovered about BD, the more I knew it was the right place for me. I am now a part of the Manufacturing Development Program, a three-year rotational program that exposes entry-level engineers to a variety of work assignments in manufacturing, quality, and research and development.  Each year, participants rotate into new positions at different BD locations, gaining diverse experiences and developing professionally.  I am currently in my first rotation of the program, working as a Manufacturing Support Engineer in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.  In this role, I am helping to support the operations of BD’s Diabetes Care facilities worldwide.  I have been exposed to the mold validation process, helped in resolving quality issues, and worked closely on cross-functional teams.  In my future rotations, I will likely get hands-on experiences in high-and-low volume manufacturing, learn to implement different continuous improvement strategies, and manage several different projects.  Being just out of college, I am excited about being able to experience so many different aspects of engineering in just a few years.  In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking, and being an active alumnae and Regional Field Director of my sorority. return to top,  Strategic Sourcing Development Program (SSDP) Name: Lei University/Degree:  Penn State University, B.S. in Supply Chain & Information Systems Program: Strategic Sourcing Development Program           I first learned about BD when I was browsing for job opportunities on the Penn State Career website. The reputation of BD and the description of the program persuaded me into competing for an interview spot with the company. I’ve always wanted to work for a medical company, and I have a strong interest in exploring career opportunities in Procurement. The Strategic Sourcing Development Program allows me to take on different roles and become proficient in procurement and the strategic sourcing processes. I like my group and my position because strategic sourcing is a fast-paced area, loaded with talented people, challenges and responsibilities. When I am not working, I like to join other BD associates in the after-hours activities that enable me to get familiar with people outside of my group.       return to top,  Supply Chain Development Program (SCDP) Name: Dipti University/Degree:  Penn State University, B.S. in Industrial Engineering Program: Supply Chain Development Program I came to know about BD from a supply chain career fair when I was looking for an internship. I interned here during the summer of 2006 and was offered a full-time position in SCDP. I decided to work for BD after graduation for a few reasons: BD culture was very welcoming, with a lot of friendly people to guide you along, and as a healthcare company which would give me good job satisfaction, competitive benefits, good location, and more. I started my third rotation in Transportation in January 2008. Some of the areas I will be exposed to within this rotation are the operational side of transportation, the freight payment process, service complaints and carrier management. My first rotation was in supply chain planning in the BD Medical - Pharmaceutical Systems unit. There, I was involved with demand forecasting, rough cut capacity planning and third-party sterilization planning. I worked on various analyses such as sterilization cycle time and building a weekly production schedule. My second rotation was with the Customer Service Call Center for BD Medical. There I was responsible for assisting customers with their inquiries on the phone, taking customer orders, analyzing service complaints, and more. The rotational program has been exposing me to many different areas within BD, which is helping me decide which areas I would like to seek long-term career opportunities. return to top,

Equally impressive was the amount of exposure and interaction I had with senior level leadership. After having had a positive internship experience at BD, I decided to join full time. Although many factors influenced my decision, such as BD’s global leadership position in the medical technology industry and its diverse product portfolio, the most important was the chance to work with people with significant industry experience who have a passion for helping all people live healthy lives. I believe that these factors will enable me to enjoy many different opportunities within BD over the course of my career, while also contributing to advancements in patient care globally. I currently work as a Manager in the Corporate Strategy and Development group. The role was extremely attractive to me because it provides me with the opportunity to work with many different groups across the organization and to apply the skills I developed in business school. On a weekly basis, I wear “different hats” as I work on a number of assignments that deal with M&A, investments, licensing deals, and internal strategy consulting. In my first few months in this role, I was able to interact with people from all three business segments, and I was able to contribute to a number of business-critical projects. I could not be more pleased with my decision to join BD. I feel like I have found the perfect fit and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.  return to top,  Technology Leadership Development Program Name: Molly University/Degree:  Brown University, ScB in Bio-Mechanical Engineering; Duke University, Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering Materials Science Program: Principal Engineer in BD Medical - Medical Surgical Systems, member of the Technology Leadership Development Program view video I learned about BD through an information session on campus at Duke. I had used BD products in the lab but had not known about the opportunities available for careers at BD.  I joined BD because both the company values and the position were in line with what I wanted in a career. I wanted to work for a company that had an interest in making society better, both locally and globally. As a medical technology company, the impact of the work you do at BD is large. We don’t produce a thousand devices; we produce tens of millions of them, so the opportunity to make an impact is great.  My role at BD is as a Principal Engineer in Advanced Concept Development. This means that I work at the front-end of product development, generating new ideas, determining products the customer will want next or finding unmet clinical needs that can be addressed. I am involved in all parts of the concept stage, from R&D to marketing to intellectual property. The thing I like most about my role at BD is that it is different day-to-day. One day I might be reading patents and the next I might be looking at BD’s sales from previous years to determine a market size.  When I’m not working, I like to cook and try to find time to read, but most of my time is spent working on my house, doing fun things like painting, hanging pictures or planting trees.

At that time I did not know anything about the company, but when my younger brother was diagnosed with Insulin-dependent diabetes, I learned first-hand the value of BD products. BD Plastipak™ syringes back then made a huge difference in my brother's quality of life. When I later learned of the opportunities at BD in my field of study, I felt working at this company would be a great chance for me to do the work I know and enjoy. I joined BD as a Senior SAP Basis Administrator. What I like most about my job is that working with SAP applications is an everyday learning experience. There is always room for improvement. Our team worked on a recent recovery and re-installation of the Advanced Planning and Optimizer system after a hardware failure - a tough task but the teamwork was exemplary. When I'm not working, I keep busy with my children. I enjoy many activities, such as music, basketball and photography. I'm also a wine enthusiast. return to top,  Name: Conrad Title: Program Manager University/Degree: Washington and Lee University, B.A. in Economics, Rider University, MBA I had known about BD for years, although I was not aware of the breadth of BD's product offerings. I was contacted by a recruiter for the position I currently hold. I was very interested in the particular job opportunity I was offered, but I really decided to join BD because I was impressed with the diversity of people and culture I came in contact with during my interview process. I was hired as a Program Manager for Anesthesia Systems two years ago and I am still in that position, although my day-to-day responsibilities have changed. I believe that with persistence and dedication I can truly make an impact through my work. I am also impressed with the way BD lives its Core Values on a daily basis. When BD purchased a business from another company, I was hired to manage the integration of that business into BD. My team was able to accomplish this mission on time and within budget. I am very proud of the way this team came together to make this happen. When I'm not working, I like to spend time with my family and friends, play guitar, try to keep in shape, enjoy new foods, and generally have a good time. return to top,  Name: Mohan Title: Senior Market Segment Leader University/Degree: Birla Institute of Technology and Science in India, M.Sc.

(Chemistry) I learned about BD from the director of a well-known medical school in Dehli, India, whose first stethoscope as a medical student, which was made by BD, was hanging proudly as a trophy in his living room. BD began operations in India in 1989, and I felt my career growth would be enhanced with an internationally known company. I was the third associate hired at BD in India and was responsible for Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC) as Business Manager of Primary Care Diagnostics. In my present position as Senior Market Segment Team Leader, I enjoy the freedom the position allows to operate and deliver the results expected of me. I am most proud of our team's development and introduction of a new needle product for Asia. BD's Core Values, a good Human Resource Planning process, the recognition of contributions, rewards aligned to contributions, and learning opportunities are just a few reasons why I continue my career at BD. Outside of work, I watch cricket and tennis (I used to play both), and read historical novels (mainly about Indian history). return to top,  Name: Glen Title: Sterilization Specialist University/Degree: Florida State University, B.S. in Physics/Mathematics I became familiar with BD because I previously worked with a company that did business with it. I accepted the position of Sterilization Specialist because I wanted to work for a reputable company. What I like most about my job, and BD as an employer, is working with great people every day. One accomplishment I am most proud of is serving as a business unit representative and team member for a successful start-up of a new sterilization facility.

As a physician, I knew of BD products. They have always been synonymous with quality and innovation. Before joining BD, I was working for a pharmaceutical company in So Paolo, Brazil. When a headhunter approached me about working for BD, I jumped at the chance. I loved the idea of working for BD for several reasons: first, the position offered a wonderful challenge, namely to be the first medical director in the South Latin America (SLA) Region. I would also have the opportunity to initiate projects and understand the practices of other countries. I became the Regional Medical Director of SLA in 2004 and came to Franklin Lakes in 2007 as Associate Medical Director in BD Medical - Medical Surgical Systems, where I am today. I love to help people, which, as a physician, is so important to my life. Because BD is a global company, every time we solve a problem or work on an innovative idea, we are effectively helping people all over the world to live healthy lives. I feel great about that! I am very proud of my work as a member of the Platform Team Medical Affairs group as well as a Core Team Medical Affairs member in Global Product Development Systems projects. I feel that through my work on these teams I am really helping patients as well as healthcare workers. There is much opportunity to continue learning and for growth.

We were given presentations on BD and its global efforts to help all people live healthy lives.  I was very impressed by the presentations and the campus setting and environment. An opportunity within the Information Technology Leadership Program listed on Rutgers career development website that caught my attention. I wanted to join after researching the position and BD's outstanding history and tradition.  I am a member of the ITLP. In my first rotation, I am a SAP Business Warehouse Presentation Developer. I create, maintain and support our Business Intelligence reporting tools and systems. My job allows me to learn about the technical and business aspects of the Business Intelligence and Data Management group. It also gives me the opportunity to work with business analysts, partners and stakeholders. My job allows me to work on value-added activities and solutions.

I am now a part of the Manufacturing Development Program, a three-year rotational program that exposes entry-level engineers to a variety of work assignments in manufacturing, quality, and research and development.  Each year, participants rotate into new positions at different BD locations, gaining diverse experiences and developing professionally.  I am currently in my first rotation of the program, working as a Manufacturing Support Engineer in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.  In this role, I am helping to support the operations of BD’s Diabetes Care facilities worldwide.  I have been exposed to the mold validation process, helped in resolving quality issues, and worked closely on cross-functional teams.  In my future rotations, I will likely get hands-on experiences in high-and-low volume manufacturing, learn to implement different continuous improvement strategies, and manage several different projects.  Being just out of college, I am excited about being able to experience so many different aspects of engineering in just a few years.  In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking, and being an active alumnae and Regional Field Director of my sorority. return to top,  Strategic Sourcing Development Program (SSDP) Name: Lei University/Degree:  Penn State University, B.S. in Supply Chain & Information Systems Program: Strategic Sourcing Development Program           I first learned about BD when I was browsing for job opportunities on the Penn State Career website.

I’ve always wanted to work for a medical company, and I have a strong interest in exploring career opportunities in Procurement. The Strategic Sourcing Development Program allows me to take on different roles and become proficient in procurement and the strategic sourcing processes. I like my group and my position because strategic sourcing is a fast-paced area, loaded with talented people, challenges and responsibilities. When I am not working, I like to join other BD associates in the after-hours activities that enable me to get familiar with people outside of my group.       return to top,  Supply Chain Development Program (SCDP) Name: Dipti University/Degree:  Penn State University, B.S. in Industrial Engineering Program: Supply Chain Development Program I came to know about BD from a supply chain career fair when I was looking for an internship. I interned here during the summer of 2006 and was offered a full-time position in SCDP. I decided to work for BD after graduation for a few reasons: BD culture was very welcoming, with a lot of friendly people to guide you along, and as a healthcare company which would give me good job satisfaction, competitive benefits, good location, and more. I started my third rotation in Transportation in January 2008. Some of the areas I will be exposed to within this rotation are the operational side of transportation, the freight payment process, service complaints and carrier management. My first rotation was in supply chain planning in the BD Medical - Pharmaceutical Systems unit. There, I was involved with demand forecasting, rough cut capacity planning and third-party sterilization planning. I worked on various analyses such as sterilization cycle time and building a weekly production schedule. My second rotation was with the Customer Service Call Center for BD Medical. There I was responsible for assisting customers with their inquiries on the phone, taking customer orders, analyzing service complaints, and more. The rotational program has been exposing me to many different areas within BD, which is helping me decide which areas I would like to seek long-term career opportunities. return to top,

One day I might be reading patents and the next I might be looking at BD’s sales from previous years to determine a market size.  When I’m not working, I like to cook and try to find time to read, but most of my time is spent working on my house, doing fun things like painting, hanging pictures or planting trees.

At that time I did not know anything about the company, but when my younger brother was diagnosed with Insulin-dependent diabetes, I learned first-hand the value of BD products. BD Plastipak™ syringes back then made a huge difference in my brother's quality of life. When I later learned of the opportunities at BD in my field of study, I felt working at this company would be a great chance for me to do the work I know and enjoy. I joined BD as a Senior SAP Basis Administrator. What I like most about my job is that working with SAP applications is an everyday learning experience. There is always room for improvement. Our team worked on a recent recovery and re-installation of the Advanced Planning and Optimizer system after a hardware failure - a tough task but the teamwork was exemplary.

I was contacted by a recruiter for the position I currently hold. I was very interested in the particular job opportunity I was offered, but I really decided to join BD because I was impressed with the diversity of people and culture I came in contact with during my interview process. I was hired as a Program Manager for Anesthesia Systems two years ago and I am still in that position, although my day-to-day responsibilities have changed. I believe that with persistence and dedication I can truly make an impact through my work. I am also impressed with the way BD lives its Core Values on a daily basis.

(Chemistry) I learned about BD from the director of a well-known medical school in Dehli, India, whose first stethoscope as a medical student, which was made by BD, was hanging proudly as a trophy in his living room. BD began operations in India in 1989, and I felt my career growth would be enhanced with an internationally known company. I was the third associate hired at BD in India and was responsible for Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC) as Business Manager of Primary Care Diagnostics. In my present position as Senior Market Segment Team Leader, I enjoy the freedom the position allows to operate and deliver the results expected of me. I am most proud of our team's development and introduction of a new needle product for Asia. BD's Core Values, a good Human Resource Planning process, the recognition of contributions, rewards aligned to contributions, and learning opportunities are just a few reasons why I continue my career at BD. Outside of work, I watch cricket and tennis (I used to play both), and read historical novels (mainly about Indian history). return to top,  Name: Glen Title: Sterilization Specialist University/Degree: Florida State University, B.S. in Physics/Mathematics I became familiar with BD because I previously worked with a company that did business with it. I accepted the position of Sterilization Specialist because I wanted to work for a reputable company. What I like most about my job, and BD as an employer, is working with great people every day. One accomplishment I am most proud of is serving as a business unit representative and team member for a successful start-up of a new sterilization facility.

As a physician, I knew of BD products. They have always been synonymous with quality and innovation. Before joining BD, I was working for a pharmaceutical company in So Paolo, Brazil. When a headhunter approached me about working for BD, I jumped at the chance. I loved the idea of working for BD for several reasons: first, the position offered a wonderful challenge, namely to be the first medical director in the South Latin America (SLA) Region. I would also have the opportunity to initiate projects and understand the practices of other countries. I became the Regional Medical Director of SLA in 2004 and came to Franklin Lakes in 2007 as Associate Medical Director in BD Medical - Medical Surgical Systems, where I am today. I love to help people, which, as a physician, is so important to my life. Because BD is a global company, every time we solve a problem or work on an innovative idea, we are effectively helping people all over the world to live healthy lives. I feel great about that! I am very proud of my work as a member of the Platform Team Medical Affairs group as well as a Core Team Medical Affairs member in Global Product Development Systems projects. I feel that through my work on these teams I am really helping patients as well as healthcare workers. There is much opportunity to continue learning and for growth.

We were given presentations on BD and its global efforts to help all people live healthy lives.  I was very impressed by the presentations and the campus setting and environment. An opportunity within the Information Technology Leadership Program listed on Rutgers career development website that caught my attention. I wanted to join after researching the position and BD's outstanding history and tradition.  I am a member of the ITLP. In my first rotation, I am a SAP Business Warehouse Presentation Developer. I create, maintain and support our Business Intelligence reporting tools and systems. My job allows me to learn about the technical and business aspects of the Business Intelligence and Data Management group.

I am now a part of the Manufacturing Development Program, a three-year rotational program that exposes entry-level engineers to a variety of work assignments in manufacturing, quality, and research and development.  Each year, participants rotate into new positions at different BD locations, gaining diverse experiences and developing professionally.  I am currently in my first rotation of the program, working as a Manufacturing Support Engineer in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.  In this role, I am helping to support the operations of BD’s Diabetes Care facilities worldwide.  I have been exposed to the mold validation process, helped in resolving quality issues, and worked closely on cross-functional teams.  In my future rotations, I will likely get hands-on experiences in high-and-low volume manufacturing, learn to implement different continuous improvement strategies, and manage several different projects.  Being just out of college, I am excited about being able to experience so many different aspects of engineering in just a few years.  In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking, and being an active alumnae and Regional Field Director of my sorority. return to top,  Strategic Sourcing Development Program (SSDP) Name: Lei University/Degree:  Penn State University, B.S. in Supply Chain & Information Systems Program: Strategic Sourcing Development Program           I first learned about BD when I was browsing for job opportunities on the Penn State Career website.

I’ve always wanted to work for a medical company, and I have a strong interest in exploring career opportunities in Procurement. The Strategic Sourcing Development Program allows me to take on different roles and become proficient in procurement and the strategic sourcing processes. I like my group and my position because strategic sourcing is a fast-paced area, loaded with talented people, challenges and responsibilities.

I interned here during the summer of 2006 and was offered a full-time position in SCDP. I decided to work for BD after graduation for a few reasons: BD culture was very welcoming, with a lot of friendly people to guide you along, and as a healthcare company which would give me good job satisfaction, competitive benefits, good location, and more. I started my third rotation in Transportation in January 2008. Some of the areas I will be exposed to within this rotation are the operational side of transportation, the freight payment process, service complaints and carrier management. My first rotation was in supply chain planning in the BD Medical - Pharmaceutical Systems unit. There, I was involved with demand forecasting, rough cut capacity planning and third-party sterilization planning. I worked on various analyses such as sterilization cycle time and building a weekly production schedule. My second rotation was with the Customer Service Call Center for BD Medical. There I was responsible for assisting customers with their inquiries on the phone, taking customer orders, analyzing service complaints, and more. The rotational program has been exposing me to many different areas within BD, which is helping me decide which areas I would like to seek long-term career opportunities. return to top,

While I enjoyed the healthcare industry, I decided to go back to school to learn more about the other parts of the business.  It was between my first and second years at Kellogg that I took a marketing internship with BD Diagnostics in Baltimore. From the very start, BD stood out among other companies because they cared about my personal development in addition to what they thought I could contribute to the company. They worked with me to identify an internship project that matched the type of experience I was seeking. Over the course of the 10-week internship I had the chance to work with many talented people across the Diagnostics organization in Baltimore and corporate headquarters in Franklin Lakes, NJ. During this time, I was impressed by BD’s collaborative culture and their “always seeking to improve” attitude. Equally impressive was the amount of exposure and interaction I had with senior level leadership. After having had a positive internship experience at BD, I decided to join full time. Although many factors influenced my decision, such as BD’s global leadership position in the medical technology industry and its diverse product portfolio, the most important was the chance to work with people with significant industry experience who have a passion for helping all people live healthy lives. I believe that these factors will enable me to enjoy many different opportunities within BD over the course of my career, while also contributing to advancements in patient care globally. I currently work as a Manager in the Corporate Strategy and Development group. The role was extremely attractive to me because it provides me with the opportunity to work with many different groups across the organization and to apply the skills I developed in business school. On a weekly basis, I wear “different hats” as I work on a number of assignments that deal with M&A, investments, licensing deals, and internal strategy consulting. In my first few months in this role, I was able to interact with people from all three business segments, and I was able to contribute to a number of business-critical projects. I could not be more pleased with my decision to join BD. I feel like I have found the perfect fit and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.  return to top,  Technology Leadership Development Program Name: Molly University/Degree:  Brown University, ScB in Bio-Mechanical Engineering; Duke University, Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering Materials Science Program: Principal Engineer in BD Medical - Medical Surgical Systems, member of the Technology Leadership Development Program view video I learned about BD through an information session on campus at Duke.

When BD purchased a business from another company, I was hired to manage the integration of that business into BD. My team was able to accomplish this mission on time and within budget. I am very proud of the way this team came together to make this happen. When I'm not working, I like to spend time with my family and friends, play guitar, try to keep in shape, enjoy new foods, and generally have a good time. return to top,  Name: Mohan Title: Senior Market Segment Leader University/Degree: Birla Institute of Technology and Science in India, M.Sc. (Hons.) (Chemistry) I learned about BD from the director of a well-known medical school in Dehli, India, whose first stethoscope as a medical student, which was made by BD, was hanging proudly as a trophy in his living room. BD began operations in India in 1989, and I felt my career growth would be enhanced with an internationally known company. I was the third associate hired at BD in India and was responsible for Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC) as Business Manager of Primary Care Diagnostics. In my present position as Senior Market Segment Team Leader, I enjoy the freedom the position allows to operate and deliver the results expected of me. I am most proud of our team's development and introduction of a new needle product for Asia. BD's Core Values, a good Human Resource Planning process, the recognition of contributions, rewards aligned to contributions, and learning opportunities are just a few reasons why I continue my career at BD. Outside of work, I watch cricket and tennis (I used to play both), and read historical novels (mainly about Indian history). return to top,  Name: Glen Title: Sterilization Specialist University/Degree: Florida State University, B.S. in Physics/Mathematics I became familiar with BD because I previously worked with a company that did business with it. I accepted the position of Sterilization Specialist because I wanted to work for a reputable company. What I like most about my job, and BD as an employer, is working with great people every day. One accomplishment I am most proud of is serving as a business unit representative and team member for a successful start-up of a new sterilization facility. Challenging work, great people and great opportunities keep me working at BD. In my spare time, I enjoy playing and watching sports, walking, bike riding, reading and traveling. return to top,  Name: Rita Title: Associate Medical Director of BD Medical Medical Surgical Systems University/Degree: Received medical degree in Brazil; completed residencies (general practitioner and endocrinology); special studies in pharmaceutical medicine and business administration; Masters degree in neuroendocrinology. As a physician, I knew of BD products. They have always been synonymous with quality and innovation. Before joining BD, I was working for a pharmaceutical company in So Paolo, Brazil. When a headhunter approached me about working for BD, I jumped at the chance. I loved the idea of working for BD for several reasons: first, the position offered a wonderful challenge, namely to be the first medical director in the South Latin America (SLA) Region. I would also have the opportunity to initiate projects and understand the practices of other countries. I became the Regional Medical Director of SLA in 2004 and came to Franklin Lakes in 2007 as Associate Medical Director in BD Medical - Medical Surgical Systems, where I am today. I love to help people, which, as a physician, is so important to my life. Because BD is a global company, every time we solve a problem or work on an innovative idea, we are effectively helping people all over the world to live healthy lives. I feel great about that! I am very proud of my work as a member of the Platform Team Medical Affairs group as well as a Core Team Medical Affairs member in Global Product Development Systems projects. I feel that through my work on these teams I am really helping patients as well as healthcare workers. There is much opportunity to continue learning and for growth. In my free time, I like to keep up with cultural events and I love to sing. return to top,  Information Technology Leadership Program (ITLP) Name: Olawole University/Degree: Rutgers University/NJIT, B.A. in Information Systems Program: Information Technology Leadership Program - SAP BW Presentation Developer I learned about BD through an INROADS training and development seminar on BD’s campus. We were given presentations on BD and its global efforts to help all people live healthy lives.  I was very impressed by the presentations and the campus setting and environment. An opportunity within the Information Technology Leadership Program listed on Rutgers career development website that caught my attention. I wanted to join after researching the position and BD's outstanding history and tradition.  I am a member of the ITLP. In my first rotation, I am a SAP Business Warehouse Presentation Developer. I create, maintain and support our Business Intelligence reporting tools and systems. My job allows me to learn about the technical and business aspects of the Business Intelligence and Data Management group. It also gives me the opportunity to work with business analysts, partners and stakeholders. My job allows me to work on value-added activities and solutions.

I am now a part of the Manufacturing Development Program, a three-year rotational program that exposes entry-level engineers to a variety of work assignments in manufacturing, quality, and research and development.  Each year, participants rotate into new positions at different BD locations, gaining diverse experiences and developing professionally.  I am currently in my first rotation of the program, working as a Manufacturing Support Engineer in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.  In this role, I am helping to support the operations of BD’s Diabetes Care facilities worldwide.  I have been exposed to the mold validation process, helped in resolving quality issues, and worked closely on cross-functional teams.  In my future rotations, I will likely get hands-on experiences in high-and-low volume manufacturing, learn to implement different continuous improvement strategies, and manage several different projects.  Being just out of college, I am excited about being able to experience so many different aspects of engineering in just a few years.  In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking, and being an active alumnae and Regional Field Director of my sorority. return to top,  Strategic Sourcing Development Program (SSDP) Name: Lei University/Degree:  Penn State University, B.S. in Supply Chain & Information Systems Program: Strategic Sourcing Development Program           I first learned about BD when I was browsing for job opportunities on the Penn State Career website. The reputation of BD and the description of the program persuaded me into competing for an interview spot with the company. I’ve always wanted to work for a medical company, and I have a strong interest in exploring career opportunities in Procurement. The Strategic Sourcing Development Program allows me to take on different roles and become proficient in procurement and the strategic sourcing processes. I like my group and my position because strategic sourcing is a fast-paced area, loaded with talented people, challenges and responsibilities. When I am not working, I like to join other BD associates in the after-hours activities that enable me to get familiar with people outside of my group.       return to top,  Supply Chain Development Program (SCDP) Name: Dipti University/Degree:  Penn State University, B.S. in Industrial Engineering Program: Supply Chain Development Program I came to know about BD from a supply chain career fair when I was looking for an internship. I interned here during the summer of 2006 and was offered a full-time position in SCDP. I decided to work for BD after graduation for a few reasons: BD culture was very welcoming, with a lot of friendly people to guide you along, and as a healthcare company which would give me good job satisfaction, competitive benefits, good location, and more. I started my third rotation in Transportation in January 2008. Some of the areas I will be exposed to within this rotation are the operational side of transportation, the freight payment process, service complaints and carrier management. My first rotation was in supply chain planning in the BD Medical - Pharmaceutical Systems unit. There, I was involved with demand forecasting, rough cut capacity planning and third-party sterilization planning. I worked on various analyses such as sterilization cycle time and building a weekly production schedule. My second rotation was with the Customer Service Call Center for BD Medical. There I was responsible for assisting customers with their inquiries on the phone, taking customer orders, analyzing service complaints, and more. The rotational program has been exposing me to many different areas within BD, which is helping me decide which areas I would like to seek long-term career opportunities. return to top,

I am a business development manager in Preanalytical Systems.  I am responsible for seeking and bringing into BD new technology, product and service opportunities that will increase revenue growth for the unit. I enjoy business development because I am able to use my background in science and business to identify new technologies that could provide innovative solutions for people to live healthy lives.  An important component of my job is to be aware of the latest and greatest innovations while simultaneously discerning whether or not there is a strategic business opportunity for the innovation.  This is an exciting and challenging task which I enjoy immensely.

While I enjoyed the healthcare industry, I decided to go back to school to learn more about the other parts of the business.  It was between my first and second years at Kellogg that I took a marketing internship with BD Diagnostics in Baltimore. From the very start, BD stood out among other companies because they cared about my personal development in addition to what they thought I could contribute to the company. They worked with me to identify an internship project that matched the type of experience I was seeking. Over the course of the 10-week internship I had the chance to work with many talented people across the Diagnostics organization in Baltimore and corporate headquarters in Franklin Lakes, NJ. During this time, I was impressed by BD’s collaborative culture and their “always seeking to improve” attitude. Equally impressive was the amount of exposure and interaction I had with senior level leadership. After having had a positive internship experience at BD, I decided to join full time. Although many factors influenced my decision, such as BD’s global leadership position in the medical technology industry and its diverse product portfolio, the most important was the chance to work with people with significant industry experience who have a passion for helping all people live healthy lives. I believe that these factors will enable me to enjoy many different opportunities within BD over the course of my career, while also contributing to advancements in patient care globally. I currently work as a Manager in the Corporate Strategy and Development group. The role was extremely attractive to me because it provides me with the opportunity to work with many different groups across the organization and to apply the skills I developed in business school. On a weekly basis, I wear “different hats” as I work on a number of assignments that deal with M&A, investments, licensing deals, and internal strategy consulting. In my first few months in this role, I was able to interact with people from all three business segments, and I was able to contribute to a number of business-critical projects. I could not be more pleased with my decision to join BD. I feel like I have found the perfect fit and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.  return to top,  Technology Leadership Development Program Name: Molly University/Degree:  Brown University, ScB in Bio-Mechanical Engineering; Duke University, Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering Materials Science Program: Principal Engineer in BD Medical - Medical Surgical Systems, member of the Technology Leadership Development Program view video I learned about BD through an information session on campus at Duke. I had used BD products in the lab but had not known about the opportunities available for careers at BD.  I joined BD because both the company values and the position were in line with what I wanted in a career. I wanted to work for a company that had an interest in making society better, both locally and globally. As a medical technology company, the impact of the work you do at BD is large. We don’t produce a thousand devices; we produce tens of millions of them, so the opportunity to make an impact is great.  My role at BD is as a Principal Engineer in Advanced Concept Development. This means that I work at the front-end of product development, generating new ideas, determining products the customer will want next or finding unmet clinical needs that can be addressed. I am involved in all parts of the concept stage, from R&D to marketing to intellectual property. The thing I like most about my role at BD is that it is different day-to-day. One day I might be reading patents and the next I might be looking at BD’s sales from previous years to determine a market size.  When I’m not working, I like to cook and try to find time to read, but most of my time is spent working on my house, doing fun things like painting, hanging pictures or planting trees.

As a physician, I knew of BD products. They have always been synonymous with quality and innovation. Before joining BD, I was working for a pharmaceutical company in So Paolo, Brazil. When a headhunter approached me about working for BD, I jumped at the chance. I loved the idea of working for BD for several reasons: first, the position offered a wonderful challenge, namely to be the first medical director in the South Latin America (SLA) Region. I would also have the opportunity to initiate projects and understand the practices of other countries. I became the Regional Medical Director of SLA in 2004 and came to Franklin Lakes in 2007 as Associate Medical Director in BD Medical - Medical Surgical Systems, where I am today. I love to help people, which, as a physician, is so important to my life. Because BD is a global company, every time we solve a problem or work on an innovative idea, we are effectively helping people all over the world to live healthy lives. I feel great about that! I am very proud of my work as a member of the Platform Team Medical Affairs group as well as a Core Team Medical Affairs member in Global Product Development Systems projects. I feel that through my work on these teams I am really helping patients as well as healthcare workers. There is much opportunity to continue learning and for growth. In my free time, I like to keep up with cultural events and I love to sing. return to top,  Information Technology Leadership Program (ITLP) Name: Olawole University/Degree: Rutgers University/NJIT, B.A. in Information Systems Program: Information Technology Leadership Program - SAP BW Presentation Developer I learned about BD through an INROADS training and development seminar on BD’s campus. We were given presentations on BD and its global efforts to help all people live healthy lives.  I was very impressed by the presentations and the campus setting and environment. An opportunity within the Information Technology Leadership Program listed on Rutgers career development website that caught my attention. I wanted to join after researching the position and BD's outstanding history and tradition.  I am a member of the ITLP. In my first rotation, I am a SAP Business Warehouse Presentation Developer. I create, maintain and support our Business Intelligence reporting tools and systems. My job allows me to learn about the technical and business aspects of the Business Intelligence and Data Management group. It also gives me the opportunity to work with business analysts, partners and stakeholders. My job allows me to work on value-added activities and solutions. When I am not working, I like reading and assistant coaching youth basketball teams. return to top,  Manufacturing Development Program (MDP) Name: Stefanie University/Degree: University of Connecticut, B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Minor in Biomedical Engineering Program: Manufacturing Development Program Through my job search of medical device and medical technology companies, I came across the BD company website.  I knew I wanted to be a part of a company that helped people, so I was immediately drawn to BD’s purpose of “Helping all people live healthy lives.”  I also learned about the positive involvement that the company has in the community, and the opportunities that are given to employees to make a difference, both locally and around the world.  The more that I discovered about BD, the more I knew it was the right place for me. I am now a part of the Manufacturing Development Program, a three-year rotational program that exposes entry-level engineers to a variety of work assignments in manufacturing, quality, and research and development.  Each year, participants rotate into new positions at different BD locations, gaining diverse experiences and developing professionally.  I am currently in my first rotation of the program, working as a Manufacturing Support Engineer in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.  In this role, I am helping to support the operations of BD’s Diabetes Care facilities worldwide.  I have been exposed to the mold validation process, helped in resolving quality issues, and worked closely on cross-functional teams.  In my future rotations, I will likely get hands-on experiences in high-and-low volume manufacturing, learn to implement different continuous improvement strategies, and manage several different projects.  Being just out of college, I am excited about being able to experience so many different aspects of engineering in just a few years.  In my spare time, I enjoy running, hiking, and being an active alumnae and Regional Field Director of my sorority. return to top,  Strategic Sourcing Development Program (SSDP) Name: Lei University/Degree:  Penn State University, B.S. in Supply Chain & Information Systems Program: Strategic Sourcing Development Program           I first learned about BD when I was browsing for job opportunities on the Penn State Career website. The reputation of BD and the description of the program persuaded me into competing for an interview spot with the company. I’ve always wanted to work for a medical company, and I have a strong interest in exploring career opportunities in Procurement. The Strategic Sourcing Development Program allows me to take on different roles and become proficient in procurement and the strategic sourcing processes. I like my group and my position because strategic sourcing is a fast-paced area, loaded with talented people, challenges and responsibilities. When I am not working, I like to join other BD associates in the after-hours activities that enable me to get familiar with people outside of my group.       return to top,  Supply Chain Development Program (SCDP) Name: Dipti University/Degree:  Penn State University, B.S. in Industrial Engineering Program: Supply Chain Development Program I came to know about BD from a supply chain career fair when I was looking for an internship. I interned here during the summer of 2006 and was offered a full-time position in SCDP. I decided to work for BD after graduation for a few reasons: BD culture was very welcoming, with a lot of friendly people to guide you along, and as a healthcare company which would give me good job satisfaction, competitive benefits, good location, and more. I started my third rotation in Transportation in January 2008. Some of the areas I will be exposed to within this rotation are the operational side of transportation, the freight payment process, service complaints and carrier management. My first rotation was in supply chain planning in the BD Medical - Pharmaceutical Systems unit. There, I was involved with demand forecasting, rough cut capacity planning and third-party sterilization planning. I worked on various analyses such as sterilization cycle time and building a weekly production schedule. My second rotation was with the Customer Service Call Center for BD Medical. There I was responsible for assisting customers with their inquiries on the phone, taking customer orders, analyzing service complaints, and more. The rotational program has been exposing me to many different areas within BD, which is helping me decide which areas I would like to seek long-term career opportunities. return to top,
