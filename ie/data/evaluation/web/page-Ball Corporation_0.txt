Over the last few years, Ball’s Talent Management programs and processes have evolved in response to the increasingly global scope of our organization, and the need for integrated, unbiased and fully inclusive practices to best support a sustainable workforce.
To best support a sustainable workforce and ensure business continuity through organizational changes, we developed a globally harmonized approach to succession management. These efforts have enabled Ball leadership to place internal talent into key roles. In 2015, for example, an internal candidate was promoted to the role of senior vice president, Ball Corporation, and chief operating officer, Global Metal Food & Household Products Packaging Division.
In 2015, Ball completed the rollout of its Global People System (GPS), which holds all core workforce information. Access to consolidated workforce data affords Ball the opportunity to effectively and accurately report on, analyze and leverage workforce-related information. We continue to assess opportunities to leverage technology in support of workforce initiatives.
An engaged workforce is critical to Ball’s success. Ball launched its first global employee engagement survey in 2012 and subsequently conducted a second survey in 2014, soliciting feedback in areas such as empowerment, leadership, sustainability, diversity and inclusion and customer focus. The 2014 survey showed an increase in participation, with more than 10,800 employee responses. Employee engagement remains high, and our results demonstrate higher levels of engagement versus manufacturing and aerospace industry benchmarks. The survey also revealed a strong correlation between Ball’s sustainability actions and employee engagement, underlining that sustainability is an important driver for talent attraction and retention, and also contributes to high employee performance.
