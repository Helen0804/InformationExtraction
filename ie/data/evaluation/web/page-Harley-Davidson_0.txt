Nothing gets more respect on the street than power. So when we built the new Softail Slim® S, we loaded it up with the most powerful engine you can get in a cruiser this year.
We went out to check the pulse of the street and then into the garage. The Fat Boy® S rolled out. Raw custom attitude with the most powerful engine you can get in a cruiser this year.
Comfort as modern as this morning’s news and the power from our High Output Twin Cam 103B™ engine, but the look still blazes straight from this machine’s authentic dresser past.

From the tip of its sleek Project RUSHMORE front fender to the tip of its chrome exhaust, the Harley-Davidson Street Glide® defines the state of the art in stripped down bagger style.
Do you want plush, top-end touring technology and infotainment or unruly stripped down bagger style? We vote yes.
