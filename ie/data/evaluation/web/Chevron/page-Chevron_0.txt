Acumentrics’s solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is designed to be fuel-flexible and to operate at high temperatures to maximize efficiencies. Unlike many other types of fuel cells, SOFC’s require a negligible amount of precious metals and instead can be made out of ceramics. Besides SOFC’s, Acumentrics is an industry leader in selling rugged, uninterruptible power supplies for military, transportation and industrial applications. visit acumentrics site, Ensyn is a producer of renewable liquid fuels and renewable chemical products from wood residues.
