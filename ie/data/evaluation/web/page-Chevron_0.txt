Microfabrica is the industry leader in manufacturing of micrometer- and millimeter-scale metal components, subsystems, and devices with features measured in microns. The company breakthrough proprietary EFAB technology can create complex three-dimensional micron-precision metal structures with unprecedented flexibility.
Oxane is commercializing advanced ceramic proppants, which augment oil and gas production (rate and total recovery) and reduce the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing. Oxane’s proppants travel deeper into oil and gas formations than conventional proppants and afford a highly conductive channel for oil and gas to flow to the wellbore.
Apprion’s comprehensive industrial wireless application provides an open, scalable, and secure platform to monitor and manage multi-vendor wireless devices and applications. Their ION system is designed to help plant managers, engineers, and IT teams build systems that can provide the critical information necessary to ensure an industrial facility is running optimally.
Acumentrics’s solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is designed to be fuel-flexible and to operate at high temperatures to maximize efficiencies. Unlike many other types of fuel cells, SOFC’s require a negligible amount of precious metals and instead can be made out of ceramics. Besides SOFC’s, Acumentrics is an industry leader in selling rugged, uninterruptible power supplies for military, transportation and industrial applications.
Ensyn is a producer of renewable liquid fuels and renewable chemical products from wood residues. Rapid Thermal Processing, or RTP, converts residual biomass from the forest and agricultural sectors, as well as cellulosic-based, post-consumer wastes, to high yields of light liquids.
Inventys is the developer of energy and capital-efficient technology for capturing carbon dioxide from industrial flue gas streams. Inventys’ proprietary VeloxoTherm™ process is less than one-third the cost of existing post-combustion carbon dioxide capture technologies and will enable the widespread adoption of enhanced oil recovery and carbon sequestration.
Moblize provides “Ready to Analyze” data from exploration to production compliant with new E&P standards to aide your decision making. Moblize’s data quality solution coupled with its “Factory drilling” analytics (used to manage wells by exception) ensures actionable information is available to decision-makers anytime, anywhere.
Panzura delivers innovative products that take an application-centric rather than a network-centric approach to storage, termed Application Network Storage. By combining application logic with storage technology, Panzura is able to provide solutions that are faster, cheaper and more secure than traditional approaches to Tier 1 Storage. This architecture allows enterprises to save costs, significantly increase performance and secure mission-critical data via public or private cloud environments.
Arisdyne specializes in designing small footprint devices that utilize controlled hydrodynamic cavitation. Controlled flow cavitation generates energy in the form of a shockwave creating a highly efficient and elegant way to reduce particle size, disrupt cell structures, and disperses agglomerates. Arisdyne applies this technology to increase yield for ethanol production, reduce catalyst consumption for biodiesel production, and change viscosity of heavy crude oil.
OsComp Systems has developed a unique multiphase compression technology that reduces initial and ongoing operating costs for natural gas producers through an efficient and cost-effective compressor package solution. OsComp’s technology reduces compression costs and economically enhances hydrocarbon production and also has future applications in compressed natural gas-refueling, pipeline stations, offshore platforms and compressed-air energy storage.
Seikowave has developed a new 3-D imaging solution using structured light which brings a cost-effective, rapid visualization system to market using developments in optics and processing algorithms. Instead of scanning one point at a time, structured light scans multiple points or the entire field of view at once. The technology is used for the non-destructive evaluation of anomalies (e.g., corrosion, gouges, dents, etc.) commonly found in pipelines, tanks, pressure vessels, and other structures.
Silixa has developed the next generation of distributed fiber optic sensing with applications in the energy and security industries.
Ziebel has developed a unique conveyance system based upon metal-encased fiber optics for measurement combined with carbon-fiber sheathing for strength and reduced weight. The Ziebel intervention technology can be used for continuous well-integrity monitoring, waste water disposal monitoring, detecting casing and packer failures, detecting water incursion, and perforation performance.
