Senior Management Mentor | Leadership Development Program | Western & Southern Financial Group


At Western & Southern Financial Group, our LDP associates have the invaluable opportunity to develop strong relationship with a C-Suite executive officer â€“ their senior management mentor. Mentors meet with their mentees regularly and make it their mission to serve as advocates, sounding boards, coaches and friends. As an LDP associate, when you are faced with a challenge or new opportunity within the program, your mentor serves as a valuable resource.
