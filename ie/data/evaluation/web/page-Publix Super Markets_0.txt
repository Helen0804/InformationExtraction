Publix is proud of our accomplishments as a caring employer, industry leader, and member of the community.
We promote from within to fill all store manager positions and most department manager positions because we want to be sure our leaders are fully aware of our standards, our best practices, and our culture. Only in rare instances do we consider external candidates for an assistant department manager opening. That doesn't mean outside candidates with supermarket management experience have to start in an entry-level position. They may be hired into positions leading to management, making them eligible to be considered for management positions in as little as six months. Please review our  for more information.
