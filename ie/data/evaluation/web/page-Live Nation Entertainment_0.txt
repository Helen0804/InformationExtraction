This Corporate Governance section of our website was established to provide you with insight about, among other things, our management team and board of directors, the composition and responsibilities of our board committees, our guidelines on corporate governance, and the code of ethics that governs the standards that every employee, officer, and director is required to follow in their service to Live Nation. We trust the materials available via this section will provide you with a full understanding of the importance of good corporate governance at Live Nation.
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with our board of directors, any committee of the board, our independent or non-management directors as a group or any individual director in writing. All such written communications must identify the recipient and be forwarded by mail to:
Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. Attention: General Counsel 9348 Civic Center Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90210
Our General Counsel will act as agent for the directors in facilitating these communications, and in doing so may review, sort and summarize the communications.
