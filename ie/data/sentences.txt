0.0::::::::By W./DALE/NELSON 
0.0::::::::Associated/Press Writer 
0.0::::::::President Reagan took the high road in his farewell address after two recent attempts to blame some of his administration 's most notable failures on congressional meddling or the Washington establishment . 
0.0::::::::Reagan sounded positive notes reminiscent of earlier speeches throughout his political career _ the pre-eminent position of ` ` We the People ' ' in the American system COMMA the image of America as a shining ` ` city upon a hill COMMA ' ' the importance of paying more attention to American history . 
0.0::::::::There was no mention of the ` ` iron triangle ' ' of members of Congress COMMA the news media and special interest groups who COMMA in a speech to political appointees in Washington on Dec./13/COMMA Reagan claimed had prevented his administration from balancing the federal budget . 
0.0::::::::Nor did he argue COMMA as he did in a speech at the University/of/Virginia in Charlottesville Dec./16/COMMA that Congress had perpetuated a dangerous situation in Central/America by its ` ` on-again COMMA off-again indecisiveness ' ' on his program of aid to the anti-communist Contra rebels . 
0.0::::::::There was no mention at all of the Contras COMMA the arms sales to Iran or the enormous trade deficits that during Reagan 's tenure have turned America into the world 's biggest debtor nation . 
0.0::::::::Instead COMMA Reagan stuck to the simple COMMA patriotic themes that have served him so well in his political career . 
0.0::::::::The best-known such warnings are George/Washington 's caution in 1797 against ` ` entangling alliances ' ' and Dwight/Eisenhower 's message in 1961 about the excessive influence of ` ` the military-industrial complex. ' ' 
0.0::::::::Reagan did not come up with a similar catchword . 
0.0::::::::It was an inspirational message COMMA unlikely to arouse the kind of criticism that greeted his attacks on Congress or the ` ` iron triangle. ' ' 
0.0::::::::Instead of blaming Congress on Wednesday for his failures COMMA he thanked the people for his successes . 
0.0::::::::` ` They never saw my troops ; they never saw Reagan 's regiments COMMA the American people. ' ' 
0.0::::::::In foreign affairs COMMA he said he wanted ` ` the new closeness ' ' with the Soviet/Union to continue but warned that it can do so ` ` only as long as they continue to act in a helpful manner. ' '

0.0::::::::He helped devise the constitutional argument that as president COMMA Nixon was immune from judicial subpoena because of executive privilege The Supreme/Court ruled 8-0 in 1974 that executive privilege did not protect Nixon from having to surrender evidence needed in a criminal case .

0.0::::::::There is speculation in the Washington legal community that because of his relative youth COMMA the 42-year-old Starr would be willing to give up his lifetime judicial appointment to better position himself for a future nomination to the Supreme/Court .

0.0::::::::The book COMMA ` ` On/the/Brink/:/Americans/and/Soviets/Reexamine/the/Cuban/Missile/Crisis COMMA ' ' is based largely on two 1987 conferences sponsored by Harvard _ one that featured top Kennedy advisers and U.S. scholars and a second in which three Soviets joined the Americans .

0.0::::::::The book said Khrushchev 's order to ignore the blockade was disclosed in a largely unknown work by dissident Soviet historian Roy/Medvedev . 
0.0::::::::The authors also conclude that the missiles in Cuba probably did not have warheads . 
0.0::::::::Their theory that the warheads were blocked by the quarantine is at odds with a recent disclosure by Aleksander/Alekseev COMMA the former ambassador to Cuba COMMA who said in a recent Soviet magazine that 42 medium-range missiles were fully operational .

0.0::::::::-LRB- Excerpts -RRB- US President Bill/Clinton 's decision to lift a long-standing trade embargo against Vietnam had been expected. -LRB- passage omitted -RRB- In his White/House speech COMMA Clinton said the time for bitterness was over and now was the time for a new beginning between Hanoi and Washington . 
0.0::::::::This is indeed laudable and the US president could not have said it better . 
0.0::::::::The reconciliation process was a long difficult one for the United/States due to the great bitterness the Vietnam/War had caused among the American people . 
0.0::::::::At that time it was perceived that a communist regime had beaten the free world superpower of the day COMMA and this did not go down well with the American people . 
0.0::::::::When the embargo was extended after 1975 COMMA its purpose was to squeeze more information from Vietnam regarding the American MiAs. -LRB- missing in action -RRB- Veterans groups and families of the MiAs were of course very emotionally involved COMMA just wanting to know what happened to their loved ones . 
0.0::::::::Hence there was a great deal of pressure on a number of US administrators to keep the embargo intact until there was a full accounting of the missing servicemen. -LRB- passage omitted -RRB- For the Vietnamese to forgive and forget is also laudable . 
0.0::::::::It has to be remembered the extent to which the Vietnamese have suffered from the ravages of war . 
0.0::::::::Since 1946 they have fought five wars almost continuously COMMA and nearly 10/percent of the population of about 71/million is totally disabled . 
0.0::::::::Because of this they have been forced to stay on the sidelines while European COMMA Australian COMMA Japanese COMMA South Korean and Hong/Kong companies have been able to get a good head start on them . 
0.0::::::::Obviously COMMA this factor has been the main point of consideration COMMA though in answering questions from reporters Clinton said the trade question did not influence his decision . 
0.0::::::::Unfortunately COMMA the lifting of the trade embargo is not quite the same as the normalization of relation between Washington and Hanoi . 
0.0::::::::However COMMA it can be assumed that Vietnam will be seeking diplomatic ties with the United/States . 
0.0::::::::Since the collapse of the Soviet/Union COMMA Hanoi has been looking for a guarantor against China 's expanding role in the region and sees Washington now being able to play the part . 
0.0::::::::The establishment of a US liaison office in Hanoi is indeed positive development and this must be seen as the first step on the path towards normalizing ties between the two countries .

0.0::::::::Last fall COMMA a group of key U.S. economists COMMA including Nobel Prize awardees COMMA issued a statement urging Japan to say " no " to U.S. demands . 
0.0::::::::Numerical targets also run counter to the Hosokawa administration 's goal of economic system reform .

0.0::::::::While the Japanese/Government has indeed worked on liberalizing its market COMMA we can hardly say the Japanese market is sufficiently open . 
0.0::::::::As a nation enjoying a huge trade surplus COMMA Japan should strive COMMA at least COMMA to avoid accusations that its market is closed . 
0.0::::::::A number of U.S. negotiators lamented that " it is like talking to the wall . " 
0.0::::::::Japanese negotiators should not only argue back at U.S. demands COMMA but should also heed the call for market liberalization humbly .

0.0::::::::As a nation which has grown more independent COMMA Japan finds itself in a difficult position . 
0.0::::::::From a position where it once enjoyed the safety and comforts of the cradle COMMA Japan must now act with responsibility as a mature nation . 
0.0::::::::I believe it was proper COMMA in that sense COMMA for Prime Morihiro/Hosokawa to say that this cannot be done COMMA this is wrong COMMA or that things are not yet ready . 
0.0::::::::I am most concerned not about what happens to the economic framework talks COMMA but that it will be terrible if the relationship of trust between Japan and the United/States disintegrates . 
0.0::::::::If the Americans think of us as saying " no " only when it suits our purpose COMMA and relying on others when we want to COMMA then the relationship of trust between the two countries will be bankrupt. -LRB- Sasaki -RRB- I think we have come to take on very heavy responsibilities . 
0.0::::::::I believe we were able to negotiate in such a manner because the political regime has changed. -LRB- Ozawa -RRB- Although the coalition government has been termed a precarious mosaic or glass work COMMA it has more breadth than the Liberal/Democratic/Party -LRB- LDP -RRB- administrations . 
0.0::::::::It is not good that we should be told by the United/States to open up our market . 
0.0::::::::The bureaucrats were also an obstacle during the time of -LRB- former -RRB- Prime Yasuhiro/Nakasone . 
0.0::::::::On the whole COMMA we followed the decision of the United/States COMMA and it was enough just to agree . 
0.0::::::::We would like the bureaucrats to use their heads for greater political issues COMMA such as Japan 's role in the international community. -LRB- Sasaki -RRB- How do you look at the issue of the DPRK 's suspected development of nuclear arms taken up during the Japan-U.S. summit talks ? -LRB- Ozawa -RRB- It is very significant that the leaders of Japan and the United/States reached basic agreement on the North Korean issue . 
0.0::::::::Japan should act properly in line with the agreement reached at the summit meeting . 
0.0::::::::Prime Hosokawa has pointed out the possibility of reorganizing the political world during the current Diet session. -LRB- Ozawa -RRB- I have the same view as the prime . 
0.0::::::::I do not mean to say it is going to be a merger only among the coalition parties or a course of the Liberal/Democratic/Party -LRB- LDP -RRB- alone . 
0.0::::::::For example COMMA I think Mr./Hosokawa should remain as prime . 
0.0::::::::For example COMMA the Social/Democratic/Party/of/Japan -LRB- SDPJ -RRB- is undergoing a very serious agony . 
0.0::::::::In handling the issues on the new multilateral trade negotiations -LRB- at the Uruguay/Round -RRB- COMMA on bills connected with political reform COMMA and on the tax cut COMMA they would have voiced their opposition without giving any thought if it were still an opposition party . 
0.0::::::::In the future COMMA we should make political parties take responsibility for 20/to/30/percent of campaigning so politicians will have enough energy to study issues and debate with bureaucrats COMMA and so deliberations can be conducted among the ruling and opposition parties at the Diet. -LRB- Oikawa -RRB- You have advocated the system of assigning Dietmen from ruling parties to the government by creating posts for two to three deputy -LRB- fuku daijin -RRB- and four to six political councillors -LRB- seimu shingi-kan -RRB- at each individual agency and ministry . 
0.0::::::::What do you say ? -LRB- Ozawa -RRB- Many Japanese speak of " deregulation . " 
0.0::::::::The political authorities should take the responsibility and make decisions on such issues as the problem of the Korean/peninsula .

0.0::::::::The return to the same state as 16 months ago COMMA when a similar COMMA but even more precise COMMA agreement between Tudjman and -LRB- the then President of FRY -RRB- Dobrica/Cosic was signed COMMA has been assessed by the Croatian president as the most important document after the UN/Security/Council 's Resolution 871 . 
0.0::::::::He also thinks that -LRB- Serbian Foreign -RRB- Vladislav/Jovanovic 's signature in Milosevic 's presence is actually the recognition of the sovereign Croatia COMMA which opens possibilities for the inclusion of the UN Protection Areas -LRB- UNPAs -RRB- in the constitutional-legal system of Croatia in a peaceful way COMMA and also that it is an enormous success of the Croatian policy that has improved the Croatian image in the world . 
1.0::::::::The most vociferous COMMA but also the most categorical COMMA has been Drazen/Budisa COMMA chairman of the strongest opposition party COMMA the Croatian/Social/Liberal/Party -LRB- HSLS -RRB- : " There is no justification for a policy that seeks an ally in the aggressor COMMA while seeking an enemy in the other victim of the aggression . 
1.0::::::::Slavko/Mestrovic COMMA secretary of the Croatian/People/'s/Party COMMA welcomes the deceleration in the case if it leads toward a just peace COMMA the reintegration of the occupied Croatian territories COMMA the return of the refugees to their homes COMMA and the cessation of the war . 
0.0::::::::He adroitly used those initiatives to preserve the regime in Serbia COMMA as well as to improve the image of himself and Serbia in international public opinion . 
0.0::::::::" Although the declaration does not mention Bosnia-Herzegovina COMMA it may mean a certain political pressure aimed at forcing a settlement of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina COMMA " Mestrovic explains his party 's attitude. Who Will Be Eating Grass ? However COMMA the Social-Democratic/Party of Croatia -LRB- SDP -RRB- believes that COMMA through this document COMMA and above all by the announced opening of the governmental offices of the two states COMMA the so-called FRY is de facto recognized COMMA while COMMA on the Croatian part COMMA the initiative has been made for the sanctions to be lifted COMMA being so far the only form of international pressure that has been put on the regime that actually carried out the aggression against Croatia COMMA as well as against other neighboring countries COMMA the regime that has been defined by the whole world as fascist COMMA the regime in which human rights are brazenly ignored . 
0.0::::::::When did he recognize Croatia in its internationally recognized borders ? 
0.0::::::::Is he not supporting the aggression these days against the Croatian enclaves in Bosnia-/Herzegovina ? 
0.0::::::::The Croatian/Peasants/'/Party -LRB- HSS -RRB- thinks that the 77th meeting in Geneva with Milosevic the Balkan Conqueror is neither the last COMMA nor the first meeting COMMA in the context of the Croatian triumphalism on one hand COMMA and Byzantine maneuvers on the other . 
0.0::::::::Of course COMMA an important factor is also the pressure by the international community that the issue of Bosnia should finally be settled COMMA that is COMMA it 's partition . 
0.0::::::::However COMMA any agreement without the accord of the third party -- this time it is Muslims -- leaves Bosnia to play its role of the land of death COMMA where the war continues COMMA to the disadvantage of the Croatian people as well COMMA " the HSS reacts to the agreement. Zagreb-Knin-Belgrade The reactions of other parties have been similar COMMA but it is discernible in these quoted statements that one dilemma dominates in the majority of the criticisms COMMA which is : Is the Croatian/Government allowed to negotiate with war criminals and the regime that attacked Croatian territory ? 
0.0::::::::True COMMA Minister Jovanovic did state that the reintegration of Krajina into Croatia should be discussed at the Zagreb-Knin level COMMA meaning that the issue of Krajina is an internal affair of Croatia COMMA but have the Krajina presidential elections not been carried out precisely in Belgrade recently ? 
0.0::::::::True COMMA in Croatia there are few statements expressing whether Milan/Martic COMMA who COMMA in the second round COMMA almost beat the already elected Milan/Babic COMMA would be more convenient than somebody else COMMA but everybody knows that Martic is Milosevic 's protegee COMMA and that he COMMA with his attitudes COMMA perfectly fits in with the concept of greater Serbia COMMA that is COMMA the union of all Serbian states . 
0.0::::::::Croatia Has Recognized the Serbian/Republic Not only the Croatian opposition COMMA but also many foreign media houses COMMA and even diplomats COMMA have assessed that the Croato-Serbian agreement constitutes a pressure on Muslims COMMA so that Zvonko/Lerotic COMMA the president 's personal adviser COMMA states that " the Muslims are thereby forced to make similar agreements with Croats and Serbs COMMA because it is suicide to wage war with two states that are about to find a common language . " 
0.0::::::::Such theories COMMA which are not alone in the international press COMMA find support in another agreement that was also signed in Geneva -- which the Croatian opposition ostensibly did not notice COMMA to the great surprise and almost astonishment of all COMMA and consequently did not comment on COMMA although the integral text was published in Croatian newspapers -- the agreement signed between Mile/Akmadzic COMMA on behalf of the Croatian/Republic/of/Herceg-Bosna COMMA and Nikola/Koljevic COMMA on behalf of the Serbian/Republic COMMA in which both sides emphasize that " there are no disputed issues between them that cannot be solved in a peaceful way .

0.0::::::::Quote : " Two republics have decided to establish diplomatic relations COMMA so that the Serbian/Republic will open an office in Mostar COMMA while the Croatian/Republic/of/Herceg-Bosna will open an office in Sarajevo -LRB- Pale -RRB- . " 
0.0::::::::Thus Croatia has actually eliminated the quotation marks from such terms as so-called COMMA self-called COMMA or self-proclaimed COMMA thereby recognizing not only the FRY COMMA but also the Serbian/Republic . 
0.0::::::::Of course COMMA the fact that Croatia did not start the war remains undisputed COMMA but many are confused by the fact that the erstwhile ally has become the main enemy now COMMA and cannot explain why that happened . 
0.0::::::::The second option is that the Muslims will continue the war COMMA and accomplish at least some of their aspirations with the help of the international community that is not so unwilling to help them as is represented by both the Croatian and Serbian media. Not a Single Shell Fell on Serbia Furthermore COMMA when we add to all this the problems regarding the access to sea that is demanded by both the Serbian and the Muslim sides in Bosnia COMMA when the questions of Bosnian/Posavina -LRB- Bosnian side of the Sava/River basin -RRB- and central Bosnia are still open to a degree COMMA when the hostility among all three factions still exists COMMA and above all that there are the issues of Sandzak COMMA Kosovo COMMA and Macedonia COMMA then it can be said that the Geneva piece of paper is just a tiny step toward peace COMMA and still far away from being called an historic one . 
0.0::::::::Far more palpable proofs than COMMA say COMMA the reestablishment of the telephone connections between the FRY and Croatia will be necessary in order for us to be able to speak of the start of a peace process . 
0.0::::::::That is to say COMMA an attentive listener and reader may also have heard in the statements made by the FRY officials assessments that the declaration makes it possible for Yugoslavia and Serbia " to get down to settling other problems as well . " 
0.0::::::::Whether Milosevic will return the favor by relinquishing Krajina and recognizing Croatia in its internationally recognized borders is the key that will make it possible for Serbia to get down to settling those other problems . 
0.0::::::::What is particularly bothersome in all these options is that nobody in Croatia sees any reasonable alternative to Milosevic 's regime COMMA because now one can hear the bellicose sounds coming from the Serbian opposition lines as well . 
0.0::::::::This " certain degree " refers above all to the unquestionable fact that not a single shell fell on Serbian ground during the war that was actually never officially declared COMMA whereas one/third of the Croatian territory is COMMA as a matter of fact COMMA devastated COMMA while Croatia as a state is reduced to a few pieces of land . 
0.0::::::::Moreover COMMA Croatia is probably the only UN member-country COMMA in addition to Bosnia-Herzegovina where the state is even more catastrophic COMMA that does not know either what its territory is or how many citizens it has .

0.0::::::::The Israelis and Americans decided it was time to regroup COMMA U.S. officials in charge of the project determined that the Arrow had to take a step back . 
0.0::::::::The American style has always been cautious COMMA step-by-step COMMA with advancement only predicated on the success of the previous test . 
0.0::::::::However COMMA in the early stage of the program COMMA the Israelis would embark on several tasks and see which one was progressing . 
0.0::::::::The Israelis involved in the Arrow acknowledged that the joint project entailed heightened media exposure COMMA adaptation to U.S. R&amp ; D standards COMMA as well as a constant reassessment of the project . 
0.0::::::::Some of the Americans involved in the Arrow COMMA like most of the Israelis COMMA saw the silver lining in its failures .

1.0::::::::Gerald/Steinberg COMMA an expert on missiles at Bar-Ilan/University COMMA agrees that the problem is daunting . 
0.0::::::::By firing plenty of Scud missiles COMMA an enemy can quickly ensure that Israel will use up its supply of valuable Arrows . 
1.0::::::::" IAI engineers are trying to enter completely new fields where unknowns dominate COMMA " says Reuven/Pedatzur COMMA a defense researcher who last month released a report on the Arrow for the Jaffe/Center/for/Strategic/Studies . 
0.0::::::::The costs will include the huge investment in the Arrow 's components COMMA such as the fire-control radar and early warning systems COMMA which he says are not being financed by the U.S. Already COMMA the government has budgeted about $120m for the radar system and at least $100m more might be needed . 
0.0::::::::Israel wants Washington to finance the development of the radar but has not received a commitment . 
0.0::::::::So far COMMA the Defense/Ministry has acquired two estimates of the Arrow 's costs -- that of IAI and the Israeli WALES/consulting/firm . 
0.0::::::::In 1989 COMMA IAI estimated the cost of developing Arrow missiles and launchers at $1.3/billion . 
0.0::::::::Pedatzur says the early-warning radar will cost $100m per unit and the cost of developing two systems will cost between $400m and $500m/. 
0.0::::::::Development of the fire-control radar COMMA which tracks the incoming enemy missile COMMA is estimated at $200m with the price of each unit at between $30m and $50m/. 
0.0::::::::The command and control system is estimated by Tadiran COMMA which wants the contract COMMA at between $40m and $50m/. 
0.0::::::::Pedatzur says the cost of the entire Arrow system to the IDF could top $6.75b/. 
0.0::::::::" Other components still in the concept stage will have to be developed in the wake of the lessons of the Gulf/war . 
1.0::::::::Aharon/Levran COMMA who has researched the Arrow for Bar-Ilan/University 's Center/for/Strategic/Studies COMMA calls Pedatzur 's estimate baseless and misleading . 
0.0::::::::He dismisses the argument by the Arrow 's IDF critics who assert that the project is not cost-effective ; one of their arguments is that it makes no sense that a $1m Arrow be used to destroy a $200/COMMA/000 Scud missile . 
0.0::::::::He has been invited to discuss his report with the IDF General/Staff . 
0.0::::::::In Washington COMMA the General/Accounting/Office -LRB- GAO -RRB- COMMA the congressional watchdog of government spending COMMA says in a report released last August that Israel might be underestimating the costs of producing and deploying the Arrow system . 
0.0::::::::The report says Washington is already providing funding not only for the development of the Arrow but for other programs related to the completion of the project . 
0.0::::::::The reference is to $54.4/million budgeted for the entire Arrow system COMMA including its radar system . 
0.0::::::::" The U.S. may be drawn into funding most of the elements needed to deploy and support a complete Israeli Arrow missile defense system in response to piecemeal Israeli requests COMMA " the GAO report says . 
0.0::::::::The study raises another question : Will the U.S. allow the Arrow to be completed ? 
0.0::::::::The GAO cast doubts on whether the Arrow is even suitable for Israel 's needs COMMA as opposed to another missile defense system being developed in the U.S. Precisely that argument was expressed when Israel was developing the U.S.-financed Lavi fighter-jet a decade ago . 
0.0::::::::At the time COMMA U.S. defense contractors demanded that their government stop spending taxpayers ' money to build a foreign airplane that would eventually compete with American products . 
0.0::::::::The IDF COMMA particularly the Air/Force COMMA pushed for the end of the Lavi COMMA saying it was unworkable and unaffordable . 
0.0::::::::In 1987 COMMA Israel decided to cancel the billion-dollar Lavi project . 
0.0::::::::Today COMMA Lavi supporters assert that Israel cannot afford to buy the top-quality U.S. airplanes that will do the job originally envisioned for the Lavi . 
0.0::::::::U.S. involvement in the Arrow is on a much smaller scale than it was on the Lavi . 
0.0::::::::Under the agreement COMMA the U.S. will own all of the Arrow technology developed . 
0.0::::::::The U.S. and Japan have argued for years over technology ownership in their joint projects . 
1.0::::::::" This is the great lurking problem in all technology transfers COMMA " says Steven/Bryen COMMA a former Pentagon official responsible for U.S. technology transfers . 
0.0::::::::They have quietly lobbied Congress and the Pentagon for support . 
0.0::::::::Pedatzur has tried to relay his fears on the Arrow to U.S. officials . 
1.0::::::::" What 's my goal ? " asks Pedatzur COMMA who now works for the Massachusetts/Institute/of/Technology . 
0.0::::::::On the other side is Marvin/Klemow . 
1.0::::::::A tough-talking former Associated/Press reporter now representing IAI in Washington COMMA Klemow protects the Arrow as if it were his own child . 
0.0::::::::He and other Israelis connected with the arrow have done their best to stop Pedatzur--a former military correspondent who still writes for Ha 'aretz--and others from speaking to Pentagon officials and congressional aides . 
0.0::::::::" He was telling people that he was doing an objective study for the Jaffee/Institute COMMA " Klemow says . 
1.0::::::::Malcolm/O/'Neill COMMA the head of the Ballistic/Missile/Development/Organization COMMA the U.S. agency involved in the Arrow COMMA told Congress last May that Israel is committed to completing the development of the Arrow COMMA regardless of U.S. aid . 
0.0::::::::Sources close to Rabin say he changed from being an opponent to a lukewarm supporter of the project during the Gulf/war . 
0.0::::::::He became a strong advocate of a missile defense system after the May/29 Nodung launch by North/Korea . 
1.0::::::::" His position is very supportive -LRB- of the Arrow -RRB- COMMA " says Oded/Ben-Ami COMMA Rabin 's spokesman at the Defense/Ministry . 
0.0::::::::" Rabin supports it 100/percent and wants them to prove that the Arrow can COMMA or cannot COMMA shoot down an incoming missile COMMA " a senior defense source says . 
0.0::::::::That will depend on U.S. aid . 
0.0::::::::" If the Americans leave the project COMMA there will be a serious debate COMMA " says Gur COMMA Rabin 's deputy . 
0.0::::::::So far COMMA the Americans have been cautious not to be drawn into the debate . 
1.0::::::::" U.S. decision-makers should understand that the signals they send today will have major ramifications for the Israeli approach to the Arrow program COMMA " says Marvin/Feuerwerger in a 1991 study for the Washington/Institute/for/Near/East/Policy . 
0.0::::::::Still COMMA the debate is already being felt in Washington and the result is that many in Congress and the Pentagon are beginning to wonder whether Israel wants the Arrow . 
0.0::::::::Senator Daniel/Inouye -LRB- Democrat-Hawaii -RRB- was confused as he made the rounds in Israel in July to warn officials that the project was in danger . 
0.0::::::::As a Capitol/Hill source put it : " From a purely political standpoint COMMA for the U.S. to withdraw support for the Arrow now will send a very terrible signal now with regard to support for Israel 's security and the peace process . " 
0.0::::::::Arens put it another way : " It 's really a very daring assumption that the U.S. would continue to fund the missile if we are not definite about it . " 
0.0::::::::" The more the Israelis debate it COMMA the more the U.S. will say COMMA ` Well COMMA it 's too controversial. '

0.0::::::::It is made up of the Venezuelan/Petroleum/Corporation COMMA the Ministry/of/Energy/and/Mines COMMA the Ministry/of/Environment/and/Renewable/Natural/Resources COMMA and the Foreign/Trade/Institute -LRB- ICE -RRB- COMMA which led the commission in filing this request through the U.S./Embassy in Caracas . 
1.0::::::::Miguel/Rodriguez/Mendoza COMMA ICE minister of state-president -LRB- title as published -RRB- COMMA pointed out that " the regulation promulgated on 15/December by the U.S./Environmental/Protection/Agency violates COMMA according to Venezuela COMMA GATT Article III -LRB- National Treaty -RRB- for establishing different quality standards for imported and domestic gasoline . " 
0.0::::::::Initial estimates indicate that gasoline exports to the United/States could drop by 50/percent COMMA that is COMMA a $150/million revenue loss . 
0.0::::::::This figure does not take into account the impact on trade of a possible exclusion of Venezuela from the U.S. market for a period of about two years . 
0.0::::::::Rodriguez/Mendoza pointed out that the Venezuelan/Government position was channeled through a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey/Kantor . 
0.0::::::::The letter calls for the start of consultations within GATT to determine the legality of regulations approved by the United/States detrimental to Venezuelan gasoline exports . 
0.0::::::::The ICE president said that COMMA based on Article XXII -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the GATT General Agreement COMMA the U.S. regulation violates Venezuela 's rights and causes that country to break its commitments . 
0.0::::::::The U.S. regulation could remove Venezuelan petroleum exports from that market .

0.0::::::::On Saturday 8/January he flies from Washington to Brussels . 
0.0::::::::There the head of the U.S. Administration will attend the NATO Council winter session and meet with the leaders of the European/Union . 
0.0::::::::On 11/January the U.S. President is to meet with the leaders of Poland COMMA the Czech/Republic COMMA and Slovakia in Prague . 
0.0::::::::From 12/through/15/January Bill/Clinton makes his first official visit to Russia COMMA and then to Belarus . 
0.0::::::::Then he goes to Geneva COMMA to meet with Syrian President Hafiz/al-Asad . 
0.0::::::::Such a busy program for the U.S. President 's European tour would appear to be intended to demonstrate an active U.S. foreign policy and Washington 's leadership following the end of the Cold War . 
0.0::::::::At the same time Clinton intends to " pay his respects " to Europe COMMA whose problems COMMA obviously COMMA were pushed into the background by domestic political concerns during the first year of his presidency . 
0.0::::::::Brussels is intended to be the main area of U.S. foreign policy efforts during the visit . 
0.0::::::::There Clinton will try not only to " revive NATO " but also to persuade his bloc allies to accept the U.S. vision of the future development of the situation in Europe and COMMA indeed COMMA in the world as a whole . 
0.0::::::::The purpose of this doctrine is to steer the desire of a number of East European states to become full members of NATO as soon as possible in the direction the U.S. wants . 
0.0::::::::While voicing support for these aspirations COMMA the United/States and most of its bloc partners are in fact not particularly enthusiastic about them . 
0.0::::::::The point is that COMMA having lost their main potential enemy in the shape of the USSR COMMA Washington and NATO are concerned about preserving the former " combat character and spirit " of this organization -- which the " dilution of NATO " by former members of the Warsaw/Pact would not help at all . 
0.0::::::::Moreover COMMA there are fears in NATO that new members would bring to the bloc the chronic disputes and problems of Europe COMMA which have come to the surface in the most obvious fashion in the course of the Yugoslav crisis and the endless war in Bosnia . 
0.0::::::::Finally COMMA Washington and the other NATO capitals obviously do not want to " tease the Russian bear " needlessly . 
0.0::::::::The " partnership for peace " is devised in such a way that " no new lines are pursued in Europe COMMA " U.S. Assistant Stephen/Oxman said . 
0.0::::::::It was no accident that COMMA at a recent Washington news conference COMMA senior administration spokesmen tried to demonstrate when pressed by East European journalists that it is not in their countries ' interests to be trying too overtly to isolate Russia and that the " success of the Russian reforms " is an absolutely essential condition of the success of the process of reforms in their own countries . 
0.0::::::::The other day Polish President Lech/Walesa even said that the West runs the risk of bringing about the revival of the Soviet bloc and the return of communist regimes in East/Europe unless it takes bold steps to incorporate a number of former Warsaw/Pact allies into NATO . 
0.0::::::::It would be a " tragedy COMMA " the Polish president said COMMA if the 10/January meeting of state and government heads in Brussels did not adopt a precise schedule for the admission of East European countries to the bloc . 
0.0::::::::And to all appearances COMMA the U.S. President is prepared to pull out all the stops to persuade his bloc allies to accept the U.S. way of solving this problem -- Washington 's " Partnership for Peace " doctrine . 
0.0::::::::Its general provisions could be described in a nutshell as follows : It offers the East European countries and the new independent states COMMA as the former Soviet republics COMMA including Russia COMMA are sometimes called here COMMA not simultaneous and proud entry but a stage-by-stage and somewhat humiliating process of " creeping " into NATO . 
0.0::::::::According to THE/WASHINGTON/POST COMMA the U.S./State/Department has already started an " intense diplomatic campaign to persuade skeptical East European governments to accept the evolutionary plans for NATO expansion COMMA rather than seek immediate membership.. . " 
0.0::::::::The main targets of the State/Department 's " attack " are Poland COMMA Hungary COMMA and the Czech/Republic COMMA which are knocking at the bloc 's door . 
0.0::::::::If these countries will not be persuaded by the United/States and resolutely reject the " partnership " they are being offered COMMA it could undermine the U.S. enterprise at the 10/January NATO summit COMMA even if the bloc allies themselves approve it . 
1.0::::::::On the eve of Clinton 's visit Madeleine/Albright COMMA U.S. representative to the United/Nations COMMA and John/Shalikashvili COMMA chairman of the Joint/Chiefs/of/Staff COMMA are going to see the East Europeans in order to prepare them properly to take on board the U.S. plan . 
0.0::::::::According to Anthony/Lake COMMA adviser to the president for national security affairs COMMA the purpose of their trip will be to dispel fears that the Washington " partnership " is intended to delay the entry of new members into NATO COMMA just to please the Russian opposition . 
0.0::::::::So Bill/Clnton 's European tour COMMA which begins very soon COMMA does not promise to be easy . 
0.0::::::::In a changing world U.S. claims to leadership need to be constantly confirmed by specific actions or new ideas capable of captivating allies and partners .

1.0::::::::I was keen to ask the following questions in an interview with Russian/Atomic/Energy/Minister V./Mikhaylov : -LRB- Gubarev -RRB- How did Ukraine lose out by this deal ? -LRB- Mikhaylov -RRB- The level of Ukraine 's security has increased -- so in fact Ukraine has benefited . 
0.0::::::::Some of the reprocessed uranium from the nuclear weapons will go back to Ukraine in the form of fuel rods for the reactors of nuclear power stations . 
0.0::::::::You must bear in mind that an extremely critical situation has developed in Ukraine regarding weapons and their storage and servicing . 
0.0::::::::It must be clearly understood : Ukraine cannot be a nuclear power -- neither the technical nor any other conditions exist there . 
0.0::::::::Moreover COMMA if Russia were not a nuclear power COMMA in present conditions we too would be unable to build weapons or to service them at the appropriate level... . 
0.0::::::::I am convinced that the agreement signed in Moscow has saved Ukraine from new " Chernobyls . " -LRB- Gubarev -RRB- What have the Americans gained ? -LRB- Mikhaylov -RRB- They have made several billion dollars on this contract . 
0.0::::::::Basically COMMA U.S. uranium-235 enrichment plants are defective . 
0.0::::::::Therefore the Americans are closing down their enterprises and our fuel is going to their nuclear electric power stations . 
0.0::::::::Incidentally COMMA there are approximately 100 reactor units in the United/States . 
0.0::::::::I think it will make about $3/billion on this contract. -LRB- Gubarev -RRB- What about Russia ? -LRB- Mikhaylov -RRB- The contract benefits us . 
0.0::::::::First COMMA the process of dismantling weapons is very expensive -- according to expert estimates COMMA it works out at $30/COMMA/000-100/COMMA/000/.

0.0::::::::It is really unfortunate COMMA in my opinion also COMMA that our papers have been carried away by this game of nations and have entered into some kind of race between them to break the good tidings to the citizen about an impending breakthrough in our tribulation COMMA while what was required COMMA according to the science of politics -- and this is another aspect of the whole issue -- was that we should not have tampered with the citizen 's sentiments and thoughts by relying on certain situations that developed here and there connected with the motives and calculations of all these sides in the Security/Council . 
0.0::::::::On this basis COMMA a Don/Quixote-like battle has taken place in which wooden swords were used COMMA and here lies the theatrical . 
0.0::::::::Those who opposed the draft of the chairman 's statement and insisted on including references to Iraq 's cooperation with the world organization COMMA but could not do so due to the opposition of the United/States COMMA Britain and Argentina COMMA should have lifted the blockade themselves or transformed the Council session into an occasion for a general debate on the sanctions COMMA which have been imposed on our country COMMA with the view to removing them or using the veto against any U.S. endeavor to prolong the blockade -- which is what I referred to in my article last Saturday -- in order to affirm the credibility of their new conviction COMMA interpret their words into actual deeds COMMA but above all COMMA affirm something which is even more important ; namely COMMA their freedom to determine their own foreign policy and to make decisions according to national and international interests COMMA not as they are required to do by others now or at any other time . 
0.0::::::::In the case of the last UN/Security/Council session COMMA we should not have relied on ready-made analyses or answers concerning the positions taken by the permanent member states of the Security/Council and other members in the Council . 
0.0::::::::When we explain to the people what happened by saying that this means the beginning of a split between the big powers because some of them -- and this is the prevalent talk now in political writings -- have began to realize the danger of being continuously dragged behind U.S. policy COMMA and to clearly see their interests with Iraq COMMA for instance COMMA which are long and historical interests COMMA we should also tell the reader that what took place in the Security/Council was a political exercise by some people for different reasons that concern only them . 
0.0::::::::Each state that spoke about the positive points in the Iraqi position did so with the aim of bargaining with the Americans over certain national and other issues by using Iraq this time . 
0.0::::::::Therefore COMMA as far as I am concerned COMMA what took place in the Security/Council does not deserve the importance it was given by our press or the foreign press . 
0.0::::::::What took place was an attempt to calm Iraq COMMA reduce world public pressure to lift the blockade on Iraq COMMA and to busy everyone at least for the present time with the game of the division within the Council without disturbing or annoying the United/States . 
0.0::::::::In the final analysis COMMA this is a gain for the United/States and not really for Iraq . 
0.0::::::::True COMMA what took place -- and regardless of the opinions expressed in this article -- was a positive development in the positions of Russia and France in particular COMMA since China is known to have expressed its reservations on every resolution adopted against Iraq right from the beginning COMMA we must not exaggerate that development COMMA unless it develops into a definite new relationship with Iraq COMMA outside U.S. trusteeship COMMA as of now and without waiting for the next Security/Council session in May .

0.0::::::::-LRB- Text -RRB- Brother strugglers : Although the explosion at Hadera COMMA in the Zionist heartland COMMA yesterday COMMA was only powerful enough to destroy just one Israeli military vehicle COMMA it shook the earth under the decaying Zionist ideology COMMA and dented the Zionists ' arrogance and racism enough to make them understand who they are and who we COMMA the Palestinian Arab people COMMA are. 
0.0::::::::On that occasion COMMA the Palestinian Arab struggle punished the wolves of the Ibrahimi/Mosque/massacre in 'Afula COMMA as called for by divine and temporal laws and moral ethics. 
0.0::::::::It would seem COMMA though COMMA that the Zionists have not recognized the 'Afula attack as a limited Palestinian Arab punishment for an indescribably savage Zionist massacre. 
0.0::::::::The Israeli military COMMA using anti-tank rockets COMMA flattened Palestinian Arab houses in the valiant city of Ramallah under their usual pretext that they were after some Palestinian Arabs on the run. 
0.0::::::::The houses and properties of all the world are not equal in value to a single Arab martyr 's blood COMMA even though martyrdom in itself is a gain and a new lease on life. 
0.0::::::::In any case COMMA let us remind Zionist injustice that by shelling Palestinian villages and camps with antitank rockets COMMA Israel has pushed the limits of terrorism. 
0.0::::::::Under these conventions COMMA these forces are guilty of a category of war crimes and mass killings that came before special tribunals after World/War/II. 
0.0::::::::For the record COMMA we will point out that Arab resistance in the occupied territories has warned the Israelis to expect Arab rockets to be fired at Zionist houses COMMA as tit for tat COMMA unless Israel refrains. 
0.0::::::::After the Arab houses were blown up in Ramallah COMMA the Israeli occupation wolves shot and killed a young pregnant Palestinian Arab woman who happened to be standing by a window in her home. 
0.0::::::::Yesterday COMMA and before the Hadera explosion COMMA a Zionist settler COMMA acting under the protection of the occupation army COMMA opened fire on Arab school children in Jericho COMMA wounding several of them. 
0.0::::::::He was able to escape with the aid of killers of the Israeli occupation army. 
0.0::::::::Hours later COMMA Arab dynamite shook Hadera. 
0.0::::::::Will Israel now learn the lesson of 'Afula and Hadera COMMA or will the Israelis revert to their terrorist COMMA arrogant COMMA and stupidly racist Zionist mentality ? 
0.0::::::::This is for Israel to answer. 
0.0::::::::If Israel learns the lesson and ends occupation and dismantles settlements and disarms settlers the road for peace will open wide. 
0.0::::::::However COMMA if Israel COMMA as we think likely to happen COMMA refuses to see sense COMMA and death to the Arabs continues to be barked by the extremists COMMA the Zionist state will be confronted by a great Palestinian Arab people who will unsheath the Israeli sword with one hand COMMA staunch their noble wound with the other hand COMMA and then hurl the sword back at Israel 's chest. 
0.0::::::::Israel must call a halt to its terror and atrocities against the Palestinian Arab people. 
0.0::::::::Otherwise COMMA the muscular hand of the Palestinian Arab people that struck at 'Affula and Hadera in the Zionist heartland will reach to any place in Palestine that the wolves of Israeli occupation imagine is out of reach of the Palestinain resistance. 
0.0::::::::The only situation under which the Zionist invaders may have security and peace is the departure of Zionist colonialism and its weapons and institutions from the last inch of our sacred Palestinian Arab land.

0.0::::::::-LRB- Excerpts -RRB- -LRB- passage omitted -RRB- Some parts of the results of the Uruguay Round -LRB- UR -RRB- of multilateral trade negotiations are either hardly acceptable or should be amended because they so vitally affect our national interests . 
0.0::::::::In this regard COMMA Kim/Chol-su COMMA minister of trade and industry COMMA spelled out the government position in these words : " Of course COMMA we need to reexamine our past mistakes to learn a lesson from them . 
0.0::::::::The government 's feeling is summed up in the following words of another concerned official of the Ministry/of/Agriculture/and/Fisheries : " After everyone has gone home upon completion of the negotiation COMMA we feel we have lost something . 
0.0::::::::The following are the grounds of this assumption : First COMMA it is too late to negotiate because our government already agreed to the UR basic principles on 15/December/1993 COMMA presented our final " country schedule " for market opening COMMA and signed the final protocol acknowledging the overall outcome of the UR round at Marrackech COMMA Morocco COMMA on 12/April this year . 
0.0::::::::Fourth COMMA should the National/Assembly refuse to ratify the agreement as demanded by the farmers ' organizations COMMA some civic groups COMMA and the opposition parties COMMA which call for renegotiation COMMA our country would end up withdrawing from the Uruguay structure and being isolated from the international community . 
0.0::::::::-LRB- In the words of Kim/Chol-su COMMA minister of trade and industry COMMA -RRB- " It is unthinkable for our country COMMA which has attained economic growth through exports COMMA to refuse to ratify the UR agreement COMMA for such refusal would make our country an international missing child . 
0.0::::::::Should our National/Assembly refuse to ratify the agreement COMMA our country would keep out of the UR system and become an international orphan . 
0.0::::::::The UR negotiations came to a close in Morocco on 12/April with the ministers of participating countries signing the final protocol and the agreement on establishing the World/Trade/Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- . 
0.0::::::::All that needs to be done is for the parliament of each member country to ratify the results of the negotiations within this year before the agreement takes effect on 1/July/1995 . 
0.0::::::::The proponents of renegotiation argue that COMMA primarily we should have renegotiated before the Morocco ministerial conference was held on 12/April and prior to submitting a final country schedule in order to attain the maximum advantages and reflect the results in the final country schedule for opening . 
0.0::::::::In fact COMMA after the basic provisions were finally approved on 15/December last year COMMA the United/States and Japan attempted to impose some tariffs on semiconductors COMMA whisky COMMA timber COMMA and in particular nonferrous metals COMMA by discarding their previous nontariffication agreement for these items . 
0.0::::::::By seizing this opportunity COMMA the ROK once drew up a plan to break its nontariffication promise and impose 3/to/4/percent of tariffs on specific items . 
0.0::::::::The United/States and Canada attempted to impose quotas on some items with a view to opening overseas farm markets in a way more advantageous to them . 
0.0::::::::Accordingly COMMA all that the ROK should do is to join the WTO by signing it by a cabinet minister COMMA and pending a formal ratification by the National/Assembly COMMA bring its case before the WTO as a member COMMA calling for a renegotiation on matters at issue . 
0.0::::::::Fifth COMMA therefore even if our National/Assembly delays -LRB- or withholds -RRB- the ratification of the WTO agreement and our government tries to renegotiate on some items COMMA we will not become " an international orphan . " 
0.0::::::::The National/Assembly 's refusal to ratify the agreement can be fully regarded as a weapon for strengthening our negotiating position and need not be considered as taboo . 
0.0::::::::In the case of the United/States COMMA it is unclear whether the U.S. Congress will ratify the agreement within the deadline . 
0.0::::::::In accordance with Article 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act -LRB- AAA -RRB- which provides that under no international agreement shall the major agricultural and livestock markets be open to the outside world COMMA and according to other domestic statutes COMMA the United/States refused to open markets for 14 basic farm and livestock products in the past . 
0.0::::::::Recently COMMA a large number of U.S. senators have resolved to reject any opening of markets for 14 basic farm and livestock products in accordance with the AAA provisions . 
0.0::::::::With considerable rough sailing and difficulty anticipated in the process of ratification by the U.S. Congress COMMA the Congress is hardly expected to complete the ratification process within the time limit set by the UR agreement . 
0.0::::::::In India there have been strong anti-UR demonstrations COMMA and the prospect is dim for an early ratification by the parliament in which the government party is in the minority . 
0.0::::::::Our trade officials were unable to interpret UR provisions properly and had to seek advice from a relevant U.S. research institute on a a slew of provisions they did not understand . 
0.0::::::::It has been conducted according to the practices of the United/States and the EC COMMA and the UR agreement is written in the letters of their alphabet . 
0.0::::::::In many cases COMMA the United/States or the EC is too formidable an opponent . 
0.0::::::::The ROK is among the countries subject to the greatest trade pressures from the United/States . 
0.0::::::::But never COMMA not even once COMMA has our government objected to U.S. trade pressures . 
0.0::::::::Other trade bureaucrats also stress that the disadvantageous results of the just-ended UR negotiation was " due to the U.S. pressures . " 
0.0::::::::Among the heads or trade ministers of developing countries COMMA no one knows better than the head or trade minister of our country how to refrain as much as possible from making any remarks that may offend the United/States . 
0.0::::::::These days when someone clumsily makes an issue of U.S. trade pressures COMMA he is apt to be branded as a sentimental nationalist lacking in international sense . 
0.0::::::::It is questionable whether this kind of stance will be of any help in trade negotiations with the United/States . 
0.0::::::::Without a shift in thinking to the stance of regarding any unwarranted demand of the United/States not as an " understandable request COMMA " but as an " unacceptable pressure COMMA " it seems highly unlikely for our trade bureaucrats to come forward on their own demanding renegotiation . 
0.0::::::::In fact COMMA the key to renegotiation is the National/Assembly 's refusal to ratify the results of the UR negotiations . 
0.0::::::::If the National/Assembly rejects ratification COMMA the executive branch will have no alternative but to carry out a renegotiation . 
0.0::::::::It will be alright for the National/Assembly to ratify the revised agreement arrived at later by renegotiation . 
0.0::::::::They are 96 DP -LRB-/Democratic/Party -RRB- COMMA 12 UNP -LRB-/United/National/Party -RRB- COMMA two KNP -LRB-/Korea/National/Party -RRB- COMMA and one NPPR assemblymen . 
0.0::::::::Still COMMA the campaign needs to obtain signatures of between 25 and 30 LDP -LRB-/Liberal/Democratic/Party -RRB- assemblymen in order to come up with 150 signatures necessary to foil ratification in the National/Assembly . 
1.0::::::::As of early March COMMA five LDP assemblymen COMMA including Kim/Pom-myon from Nonsan/County COMMA reportedly signed the pledge to vote no to the ratification motion . 
0.0::::::::The " National Campaign Headquarters " has concentrated its efforts on 35 rural districts throughout the country COMMA including four in the Taejon-/Chungnam/area and seven in the Taegu-Kyongbuk/area COMMA contacting DLP parliamentarians in these areas in an effort to persuade them .

0.0::::::::-LRB- Text -RRB- Government officials and analysts are casting a suspicious eye at the role of the United/States in Korea 's run-up to entry to the Western well-to-do countries club of the Organization/for/Economic/Cooperation/and/Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- . 
0.0::::::::They suspect that Washington might seek to remote-control Korea 's opening its markets and industries wider by taking advantage of Seoul 's planned move to become an OECD member in 1996 . 
0.0::::::::Some government officials said that the United/States might have two game plans in connection with Korea 's OECD membership . 
0.0::::::::One strategy would be to suspend the current bilateral trade talks and encourage Korea to join the OECD . 
0.0::::::::Once Korea joins the OECD COMMA the United/States will pressure the OECD members to have Korea further open its markets COMMA they said . 
0.0::::::::The other plan of the United/States might be to intensify its pressure on Korea before its entry so that Seoul is forced to open its markets wider and wider . 
0.0::::::::A government official who wished to remain anonymous COMMA said COMMA " Washington has already read the Kim/Yong-sam administration 's political will to join the OECD during Kim 's tenure . " 
0.0::::::::It will intensify pressure on Seoul to meet the guidelines COMMA practices and rules that OECD countries maintain COMMA he speculated . 
0.0::::::::But he said that public sentiment will be in disfavor of Seoul 's OECD membership if the United/States is portrayed as playing a " behind-the-scene role " in opening the Korean market . 
0.0::::::::The National/Assembly will become vocal if lawmakers are persuaded that Washington is seeking to take advantage of the nation 's OECD membership as an excuse to open Seoul 's markets wider COMMA he said . 
0.0::::::::The U.S. role will have a critical impact on the nation 's view of the merits and demerits of joining the OECD COMMA he said COMMA adding that the best strategy for the United/States would be " to take a wait and see attitude to Korea 's membership negotiation with the Paris-based organization . " 
0.0::::::::It may be quite dangerous if the Korean people see the OECD membership as another Uruguay Round COMMA he added . 
0.0::::::::It is the commitment of President Kim/Yong-sam . "

0.0::::::::The MOF said Korea will initiate negotiations with the OECD in the latter half of next year for the nation 's application for membership . 
0.0::::::::Seoul hopes that Korea will be given a full grace period to meet OECD requirements even after becoming a member . 
0.0::::::::But if the OECD COMMA egged on by the United/States COMMA is rigid in demanding Korea open its markets wider COMMA there is a risk that Korean may be forced to delay the membership application at the later stage COMMA government officials said . 
0.0::::::::They said COMMA " It is a privilege for the OECD to have such fast-growing countries as Korea as its members . "

0.0::::::::unidentified reporter ; place and date not given -RRB- -LRB- Text -RRB- CLARIN : Will the CNEA -LRB-/National/Commission/for/Atomic/Energy -RRB- be privatized ? 
0.0::::::::In Argentina we developed our own nuclear industry COMMA with our own technicians COMMA heavy water fuel COMMA and companies . 
0.0::::::::The Energy/Secretariat COMMA as the agency responsible for determining policies COMMA is deeply interested in seeing nuclear energy as one of the future energy options in Argentina . 
1.0::::::::CLARIN : There is a study conducted by the Mediterranean/Foundation headed by Juan/Novara saying that the CNEA is not competitive and that nuclear energy is expensive COMMA dirty COMMA and is being abandoned throughout the world .

0.0::::::::The CNEA contributed $8.5/billion compared with the $600/million that could be obtained from the selling of all the shares . 
0.0::::::::I said it was because a barrel of crude today costs $14 and these estimates are based on this oil price .

0.0::::::::CLARIN : The CNEA argues that they owe it $500/million .. . 
0.0::::::::CLARIN : I insist COMMA do you not think that $600/million is a very low price for two nuclear power plants that are already operational COMMA Atucha-II -- 70 percent of which is already completed COMMA and other industrial plants ? 
0.0::::::::We will never have a 100/percent return on investment for Atucha-II because it is a capital-intensive sector .
